Generate the code for the function equation_v1 with the score higher than in exp_buf.
The purpose of equation_v1 is to describe the field u(t, x), that is provided in the form of the image.
Your task is to find the partial differential equation skeleton to which the function u(t, x) is a solution.

### Example: ###

Input: u = np.array([[0., 4.], [24., 28.]])
Output: d^2u/dt^2 = -2 * d^2u/dtdx + 3 * d^2u/dx^2
Explanation: the data on u seems to be from the equation u(t, x) = 3t^3 + x^2.
For which the governing partial differential equation is d^2u/dt^2 = -2 * d^2u/dtdx + 3 * d^2u/dx^2

Additional information:
-The best equations, scored by evaluate() are placed into the experience buffer exp_buf. While proposing new equation make sure it is unique inside exp_buf.
-equation_v1 must be found with the structure that maximizes the evaluate() function.
-Although you are provided with the image for u(t, x), the actual u_true differs in values, e.g. for input u = [[0, 227, 158], [13, 242, 172], [27, 255, 185]] the values of u_true = [[0.0, 0.827, 0.57], [0.05, 0.877, 0.623], [0.1, 0.927, 0.673]]. Thus, u(t, x) only contains the relationships between the values of u_true.
