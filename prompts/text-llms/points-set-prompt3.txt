What is a possible function with the general equation form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx) that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of 't x u du/dx du/dt'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
Note that although the general equation form is du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx), the resulting equation may take on simpler forms, like du/dt = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.

Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
