What is a possible function with the general equation form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx) that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of 't x u du/dx du/dt'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure.

def loss_function(params, t, x, u, derivs_dict):
    u_pred = equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params)[0]
    return np.mean((u_pred-derivs_dict["du/dt"])**2)

def evaluate(data: dict) -> float:
    """ Evaluate the constructed equation"""
    inputs, derivs_dict = data['inputs'], data["derivs_dict"]

    # Optimize equation skeleton parameters
    loss_partial = lambda params: loss_function(params, *inputs, derivs_dict)
    params_initial_guess = np.array([1.0]*P)
    result = minimize(loss_partial, params_initial_guess, method='BFGS')
    optimized_params = result.x

    # Return evaluation score
    score = loss_function(optimized_params, *inputs, derivs_dict)
    return -score if not np.isnan(score) and not np.isinf(score) else None
