What is a possible function with the general equation form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx) that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of 't x u du/dx du/dt'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The answer should be unique inside the dictionary exp_buffer, which stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function.
