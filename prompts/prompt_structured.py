# Generate the code for the function equation_v1. The purpose of equation_v1 is to describe the field u_true that will be provided below.
# Your task is to find the mathematical function skeleton given data on the values of unknown mathematical function u_true(x0, x1) dependent on time x0 and space x1.
#
# -The function equation_v1 should return the derivative of u_true: du/dx0, which is called the balancing term.
# -The proposed function skeleton must have a better score than the ones in exp_buffer - the experience buffer, where the pairs of previously discovered equations and their scores are stored.
# -The new structure of equation_v1 must be unique inside the experience buffer.
# -For constructing equation_v1 you can use any function of x0, x1, u or any derivative of u except for the balancing term.
# -Equation_v1 must be found with the structure that maximizes the evaluate function.
# -Make sure to only output the function equation_v1.
