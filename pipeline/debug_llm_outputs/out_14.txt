Based on the provided dataset and the exp_buffer, an equation structure can be suggested that potentially fits the data but has not been evaluated before. Looking at the previous attempts detailed in exp_buffer, we can notice that equations dependent on the derivative 'du/dx' and its combination with 't' or other variables (like 'u' or 'd^2u/dx^2') usually result in lower scores. 

Since the best score is 0 and the equations with scores lower than 625 aren't listed in the exp_buffer, aiming for a lower score (a better fit), we will suggest a mildly complex equation using 'du/dx' and 't', which are well represented in the previous attempts, and 'd^2u/dx^2', which is also common but not always present. The result should utilize variables and derivatives different from those with equations already presented in exp_buffer or have not the same structure.

Considering the above, a guess can be made: du/dt could be a function of 't', 'du/dx', and 'd^2u/dx^2' (second spatial derivative), with two constant coefficients (for now), one for the spatial first derivative ('du/dx') and one for the product of 't' and the second spatial derivative ('d^2u/dx^2'). These choices make sense because 'du/dx' and 't' show up regularly across the previous attempts, indicating their importance in the dataset's structure, while 'd^2u/dx^2' is also reasonably frequent and has been proven effective when combined with 't'.

Thus, an acceptable result could be,

`du/dt = c[0]*du/dx + c[1]*t*d^2u/dx^2`

The structure of this equation is not entirely similar with any of those in exp_buffer in term of used variables, hence would give a new guess about the equation to the equation;

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This is a fairly simple equation, but it's different from the structure already contained in exp_buffer. It includes the requirement for at least one derivative to be involved, and because it's in the form "c[0] * derivative1 + c[1] * derivative2", it's simplified as per the criteria. This equation uses the first spatial derivative, 'du/dx', and the product of 't' and the second spatial derivative, 'd^2u/dx^2'. These choices seem to be informed by the common usage of these variables in the exp_buffer and their potential relevance to the behavior of the dataset.

The suggested equation is dependent on both the first derivative, 'du/dx', and the second derivative, 'd^2u/dx^2', which is in line with the requirements. This might help us in making an improved guess about the structure of the equation compared to previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer.
