Based on the previous attempts stored in exp_buffer, which seem to be unsuccessful as the best score (lowest error) is still 4.12, a new attempt can be constructed by combining the successful terms from these equations with additional terms that may improve the fit.

Considering the general form given, we can try to introduce terms that include 't', 'x', 'u', and higher-order derivatives such as 'd^2u/dx^2', while making sure to include 'du/dx'. We will also aim to keep the equation simple and avoid duplicating previous attempts.

One possible equation that hasn't been attempted with a score of 0 (best case) is:
- d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * x * (du/dx) + c[3] * t * (du/dx)

This equation includes 't', 'x', 'du/dx', and (du/dx)^2 while adhering to the given requirements and avoiding exact copies of previous attempts.

Below is the function representation of the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2 + params[2] * x * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]) + params[3] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * x * (du/dx) + c[3] * t * (du/dx)"
    len_of_params = 4
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

This equation includes all the required components as specified in the requirements and is not a copy of those in exp_buffer. The score will need to be evaluated using the given evaluate function to test its effectiveness on points_set.
