Based on the exploration and analysis of simpler structures, let's advance to a more complex interaction. Let's examine an interaction between u and its derivative du/dx and how they affect the rate of change du/dt, especially with the adjustments for each step of the differentiation chain. Given that the previous explorations didn't get close to a score of 0 and aimed for a simpler interaction, now we could include u explicitly given its apparent involvement.

The proposed structure can be summarized as follows:

```python
# Right side of the equation is constructed with du/dx, u, and combination of them.
right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
# The equation in a string form with constants c[].
string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx"
# Length of the parameters needed for equation evaluation.
len_of_params = 2  
```

This equation offers a new structure. It's worth noting that while the interaction between u and du/dx might not directly reveal the time (t) or space (x) involvement, it offers a new perspective. The equation involves du/dx (to match the requirement for including derivative) and directly interacts with u (sounds like an attempt to capture growth, decay, or reaction dynamics depending on how the equation fits the data).

Let's implement it to see if the altered combination helps get closer to finding the dynamics represented in the 'points_set' data.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Constructing right part of the equation
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    # Suttring the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
Note: In a case this equation is discovered not useful, subsequent steps should involve constructing equations that differ more substantially (ie. by including powers, more products, etc.)

This structure is not a duplicate from exp_buffer, neither is a part of the form that has been evaluated already (not a "du/dt = c[0] * u ** x + y" situation), thus should satisfy all the statement requirements.
