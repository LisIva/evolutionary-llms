After analyzing the provided data points and equations in the exp_buffer, I suggest a new equation that is not in the exp_buffer and is dependent on at least one derivative, in this case, 'du/dx'.

**Suggested Equation:**
\[ d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * x * (du/dx) * t \]

Let's translate this into a function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * x * du/dx * t"
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len(params))

```

We have created a new equation that is not in the exp_buffer and is a linear combination of 'du/dx', 'u * du/dx', and 'x * du/dx * t', by adding 'c[2] * x * du/dx * t' to the equation that exists in the exp_buffer. This meets the requirements of being dependent on at least one derivative ('du/dx') and not copying any equations from the exp_buffer.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Equation construction with factors t, x, u, and derivatives
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * x * du/dx * t"
    len_of_params = 3
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)

```
