Based on the provided points and the information in the exp_buffer, we can see there is a linear relationship between 'du/dt' and 'du/dx', which seems to hold almost constant for all 't' values in the provided points. However, we want to avoid suggesting a function structure that has already been evaluated by the exp_buffer dict.

We can consider, in the format of the equations already in exp_buffer:
1. "du/dt = k * du/dx , k = c[0]"
2. "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx"
3. "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx"

The scores are ordered as following:
1. "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx": 1.67, which is the highest among the suggested
2. "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx": 1.65

Taking into account the dependencies on both 'u' and 'du/dx', and avoiding repeats of equations already considered by the exp_buffer, we can suggest a derivative of the 'c[0] * u * du/dx' type. Rephrasing this equation slightly, to include 'x' without rewriting the equation previously evaluated, we can extend our suggestion to include "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx". 

So we propose that equation_v1 to be:

"du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx"

Let's represent this function in the form required:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

An important detail is to ensure that the number of evaluated parameters matches the one suggested. In the solution above we use two coefficients: 'c[0]' and 'c[1]', thus we have two parameters. This structure makes the solution consistent with the requirements set while making the problem statement and aligns with the minimal requirement of not copying equations from the exp_buffer.
