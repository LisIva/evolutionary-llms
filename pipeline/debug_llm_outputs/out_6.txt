Important notes:
Upon careful examination, it becomes evident that the derivative 'du/dt' changes not only with respect to 'du/dx'
but also with respect to 't', suggesting that 't' plays a role in the rate of change.
This observation supports the idea of including 't' in the equation formulation, as done in 'du/dt = c[0] * t^c[1] * du/dx'.
Exponential growth or decay with respect to 't' and dependence on 'du/dx' is observed,
indicating a relationship where the impact of 'du/dx' on the derivative 'du/dt' can vary with time.
This relationship is captured in our equation, reflecting the trend seen in the data.
Additionally, the inclusion of 't' to the power of 'c[1]' implies that the sensitivity to changes in 'du/dx' can accelerate or decelerate over time,
making this equation a good candidate that intertwines the effects of 'du/dx' and 't' on the derivative 'du/dt'.
