```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * u * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This equation was chosen because it is a next step in complexity from expressions in the exp_buffer, adding a term dependent on u times the second power of du/dx, which wasn't previously used. This particular expression was chosen to examine any interactions between the second power of the derivative and the second variable u, and to see whether there is any dependency between u and its second derivative in relation to t.
