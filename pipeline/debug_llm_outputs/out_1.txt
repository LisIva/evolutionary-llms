```python

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```
This equation was chosen because the exp_buffer shows that 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx' has already been tested, so we can increase the complexity of the du/dx term by squaring it. This new function allows us to see if the rate of change of u over dx has a quadratic impact on the rate of change of u over time.
