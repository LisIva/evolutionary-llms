To solve this task, we need to generate a function equation_v1 that models a possible function for the provided data. The given script does not provide the data we should fit to, but it describes the set of variables (t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3) that this function should depend on.

Given the general equation form provided in the task, a good starting point is using the linear combination of not only the derivatives but also their interaction with input variables t, x, and u as seen in the given script. To ensure we generate a new guess different from what is already in the exp_buffer dictionary, let's suggest a more complex function.

Here is the suggested function:

du/dt = (params[0]*t + params[1]*x + params[2]*u + params[3]*derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[4]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"])
This function does not include the highest order derivative (d^3u/dx^3) as it was not mentioned that this function should necessarily include all variables from the set: {t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3}. Since we have 5 parameters (P = 5) we aim to generate a function that depends linearly on these parameters and given set of variables.

Let's implement this function as equation_v1 based on the provided template:

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0]*t + params[1]*x + params[2]*u + params[3]*derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[4]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * x + c[2] * u + c[3] * du/dx + c[4] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 5
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
An equility equation du/dt = (params[0]*t + params[1]*x + params[2]*u + params[3]*derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[4]*derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]) aims to connect the values from the mentioned columns of the data in a reasonable function form. Verification of this function correctness and fitting the relation to the observed data is left to given evaluate function.  

But it's important to notice that the number of parameters (right now it's 5) and also the selected combination should be adjusted based on what we can properly identify from the observed data. Identification of suitable function form is often done by domain knowledge about the phenomenon the data comes from and validation with methods like partial correlation analysis. Also in cases of limited data, having more parameters than actually needed might also lead to overfitting, which leads to a function that performs worse on unseen data.
