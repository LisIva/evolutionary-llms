The problem you've presented is a regression task, where the optimal function should be found in a form of d^2u/dt^2 = F(t, x, u, du/dt, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2) using the given points_set data and the previous attempts in the exp_buffer.

Firstly, to approach this problem, let's review the given data in points_set. The data rows consist of 't (time)', 'x (position)', 'u (value of function)', 'du/dt (first derivative w.r.t. time)', 'du/dx (first derivative w.r.t. space)', 'd^2u/dt^2 (second derivative w.r.t. time)', 'd^2u/dx^2 (second derivative w.r.t. space)' values for different t and x. By comparing the provided exp_buffer:

```
exp_buffer = {
"d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u": 4.12,}
```

and the points_set data, we can infer that certain variables somehow correlate or constitute the equation for 'd^2u/dt^2', despite the fact the particular dependency is not straightforward.

The problem is a black box problem and without further information about the 'd^2u/dt^2' behaviour, only assumptions can be made of the appropriate structure of the equation. Taking account of the requirements, at least two derivations must be present in the equation.

To generate an equation that fits to the data points better than previously stored in exp_buffer, let's take a different approach and consider the relationship between 'd^2u/dt^2' and 'du/dx' as a linear function with one additional term, 'u'. We can suggest a new form of the function:

d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] * (du/dx)^2.

This lets us add nonlinearity to the model. The square term can be used to consider potential countering forces. Furthermore, it can adjust the model to the data better than the linear function.

To generate the function, you can implement the following Python code:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u + params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2))
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

The above code reflects the new function (equation) with the suggested structure and parameters. Please note that if the function structure does not suit your data, consider implementing a different one to better fit the function and increase model performance. Additionally, note that certain function forms (linear, logarithmic, hyperbolic, algebraic, etc.) may be more fitting than others depending on the nature of the observable phenomena. If there is any background information known about the observable phenomena or observed variables, it should be taken into account during the equation structure generation processes.

If the new function structural complexity is a concern, you can keep trying to generate simpler equations by removing less significant terms from the equation or by implementing a simpler equation structure in the 'equation_v1' function.

Remember, the accuracy of the generated equation highly depends on its structure (form) and chosen adjustable parameters (c[0], c[1], c[2]) that are optimized during the minimization process. Hence, to acquire the optimal equation, consider thoroughly analyzing your data and its behaviour to properly choose the equation structure thus reflecting the observed phenomena and yielding the most optimal model. If there is no background information available, consider using more sophisticated equation generation techniques like symbolic regression or implementation of more complex equation forms.

If your models/evaluated equations keep yielding unsatisfactory results, it might be worth considering utilizing approximation methods, like interpolation, and/or increasing the complexity of the equation (by adding variables) to better match the data. However, be cautious as highly complex equation form might lead to overfitting.
