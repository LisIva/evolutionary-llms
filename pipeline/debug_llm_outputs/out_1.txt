Important notes:
The relationship between du/dt and du/dx seems to be most accurately described when considering the interaction with the variable t.
In the multiplicative form of du/dt = F(t, du/dx), 
the expression has a trend showing that du/dt is proportionally related to du/dx and more importantly is influenced 
by the value of t possibly demonstrating a decay or exponential-like relationship.
The multiplicative factor t affects the strength of the relation between du/dt and du/dx, 
highlighting the changing dynamic of du/dt relative to du/dx across the sampled "t" intervals.
This equation incorporates the dependence of du/dt on du/dx and "t", 
notably expanding on the previous suggestion to include a temporal factor for the influence of t on du/dt.
