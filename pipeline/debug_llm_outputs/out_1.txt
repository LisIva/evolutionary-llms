From analyzing the data set and the experiments buffer, let's formulate a possible equation that recreates the given behavior and is not yet included in the buffer.

Looking at the data, it's apparent that the rate of change of \(u\) (\(\frac{du}{dt}\)) seems to follow a pattern where increasing the derivative of u with respect to x (\(\frac{du}{dx}\)) also increases the rate of decrease of u over time. Moreover, the rate of decrease is not constant but more impactful at higher values of the derivative.

Given that the form of equation is du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx), it is suggested to assume a linear relation with the derivative term. From the experimental buffer, the simplest form du/dt = k * du/dx with k as a constant, can be used as the starting point.

- Upon analyzing the data, it is noticed that the rate of decrease also seems proportional to the value of u itself. More specifically, the reduction in \(u\) over time is more prominent when \(u\) is relatively large. This hints at a second order behavior in \(u\).
- However, if we would include the time and x in the expression that does not seem to change the prediction performance, or they are not included in the equations in the experiment buffer, we would not add complexity by including them in the equation.
- The term du/dt also appears to be dependent on time, with the rate of decrease of u tending to be more substantial as \(t\) progresses, although not uniformly across different values of du/dx.

Knowing these observations, the first approach would be to consider a simple extension to the experiment equation 'du/dt = k * du/dx', modifying it by multiplying a factor of \(u\) to \(du/dx\), yielding:
\[
du/dt = k * u * du/dx
\]

This equation introduces a dependency not only on the derivative of \(u\) with respect to \(x\) (\(\frac{du}{dx}\)) but also on theinstantaneous value of \(u\), which follows the observations.

The function with this form, then, could be represented in code as follows (assumptions for P):
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
  right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
  string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx"
  len_of_params = 1
  return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

The number of parameters P in this case is set to 1 as only one scalar constant is needed to satisfy the equation.

This equation demonstrates a sensitivity of the rate of change of \(u\) over time \(\frac{du}{dt}\) to not just the spatial gradient \(\frac{du}{dx}\), but also the magnitude of \(u\) itself. Therefore, it's a logical extension of the initial form du/dt = k * du/dx, satisfying the requirement of introducing a new equation with a different structure.

Please, make sure to test the equation inline to confirm its validity and ensure it wasn't already included in the exp_buffer. If the suggested function description matches the data, the evaluation function provided in the initial code will quantify the degree of fitting. The lower the result score, the better the match. If the score is lower than 30922, the equation is more accurate than the ones previously evaluated.
