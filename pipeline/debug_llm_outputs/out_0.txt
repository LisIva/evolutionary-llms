Given the provided dataset, the pattern observed is that `du/dt` seems to be directly proportional to `du/dx`. Based on this observation, we can assume a linear relationship where:

\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

Where \( c \) is a constant parameter to be determined. The dataset seems to have a consistent value of \(\frac{du}{dt}\) close to -0.5 at the beginning, which decreases gradually as \( t \) increases.

We will implement this assumption in the function `equation_v1`:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    """Generate the code"""
    c = params[0]
    right_side = c * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"{c} * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

To test the correctness of the model, you can run the following snippet:

```python
# Example of usage and test
from numpy import array

# Input data (example slice of your points_set)
data = {
    'inputs': (array([0.0, 0.05, 0.11]), array([-1000.0, -947.4, -894.7]), array([500.0, 513.5, 527.8])),
    'derivs_dict': {"du/dt": array([-0.5, -0.514, -0.528]), "du/dx": array([251.3, 263.8, 278.6])}
}

# Test the evaluate function with a simple set of params (e.g., [c])
score = evaluate(data)
print(f"Score: {score}")

# Example usage of equation_v1
params = array([-0.0019])
right_side, equation_str, _ = equation_v1(*data['inputs'], data['derivs_dict'], params)
print(f"Right Side: {right_side}")
print(f"Equation: {equation_str}")
```

This should output a reasonable score if the relationship between `du/dt` and `du/dx` holds, and also print out the evaluated `right_side` and the string form of the equation. Adjust the value of `c` to get a better fit based on the minimization routine provided.
