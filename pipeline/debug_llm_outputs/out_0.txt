In the solution provided, we explored a quadratic term involving 'du/dx', which was not previously examined. The equation simplified in the string form opens all the brackets and presents the terms as 'du^2/dx^2' to follow the instruction. Furthermore, it includes at least one derivative term as required. As a result of the guidelines, the equation is dependent on 'du/dx' and its square, which uncovers a possible inexplicit interaction between the derivatives.
