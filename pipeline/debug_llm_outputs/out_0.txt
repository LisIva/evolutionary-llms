Given the problem statement and the input data provided, the goal is to devise a differential equation that best fits the relationship specified by the `du/dt` evaluations for given `t, x, u,` and `du/dx` data points.

From the input data, we observe that the `du/dt` evaluation changes only with time `t`, which hints that the differential equation might not depend explicitly on `x` and `u`, but primarily on `t` and possibly `du/dx`. The rate of change of `u` with respect to `t` (i.e., `du/dt`) seems to decrease linearly with time, implying that the differential equation might have a time-dependent term. Simultaneously, considering the general equation form `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx)`, we can notice a close relation between `du/dt` and `du/dx` - as `du/dx` is always negative and its magnitude increases with time, `du/dt` seems to follow the same trend yet proportionally smaller. This points us to consider a simple multiplier for `du/dx` as part of the function `F`.

Given this, a simple equation concept is of the form `du/dt = a * du/dx`, where 'a' may or may not specifically depend on time `t`. However, by considering only the `du/dt` and `du/dx` columns, we neglect other variables as their contribution to `du/dt` seems indirect or non-existent in the provided dataset.

Let's construct the equation as suggested, with the coefficient `a` being optimized to fit the dataset. The following is the proposal for `equation_v1`:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    len_of_params = 1
    c = params[0]

    # Construct a function for du/dt based on the data-driven insights
    # and the parameters optimized through the loss function.
    right_side = c * derivs_dict["du/dx"]

    # Define the equation in string format, useful for debugging and reporting
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {c:.4f} * du/dx"
    
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

# Initial guess for optimization, based on preliminary observation that the multiplier is close to the duidt evaluation at t=0
params_initial_guess = np.array([0.5])
result = minimize(loss_partial, params_initial_guess, method='BFGS')

optimized_params = result.x
params = optimized_params

# Construct the equation
right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params = equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params)

# Print the optimized equation and parameters
print(f"Optimized equation: {string_form_of_the_equation}")
print(f"Number of parameters: {len_of_params}")
```
Please note, it must be understood that refining this simple multiplier further could incorporate a time-dependent factor, although that is not covered by the current simple structure. In the context of the existing data, this multiplier is a rudimentary representation of a potential relationship between `du/dt` and `du/dx`, adjusted to best reflect the provided `du/dt` evaluations.
