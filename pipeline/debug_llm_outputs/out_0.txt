Based on the given data and the general form of the equation \( d^2u/dt^2 = F(t, x, u, du/dt, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2) \), it seems we can build a relatively simple model to explain the dynamics of \( u \) with respect to \( t \) and \( x \), given the derivatives provided. A simple initial approximation based on the data you have given points to an equation of the form:

\[ d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u \]

Intuitively, the acceleration in \( u \) (with respect to time) could be proportional to its gradient with respect to \( x \) and also to its current value. This is a common form in many physical systems, where the rate of change in acceleration could depend on the gradient (trend) and value (state) of the system.

However, this is a highly simplified model and might not capture the full dynamical behavior of \( u \). To create such a function using the given points_set data, we can create 'equation_v1' based on 'equation_v0'. 

For example:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u  
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

Note that we now have 2 parameters (c[0], c[1]) that should be optimized to best fit the data. The next step would be to optimize these parameters using the 'loss_function' and 'evaluate' methods provided in your snippet. Make sure to adjust the number of initial guess parameters to match the number of actual parameters (P = 2) in 'equation_v1'. 

Also, please disregard other parts of the data which are not necessary for this purpose. The method of the optimization and the evaluation part can stay as they are. As long as your data points follow your 'equation_v0' hypothetical function, the final optimized equation parameters ('equation_v1') should result in the proper dynamics of your system. 

After optimization and evaluation, you should get the right set of parameters 'c' which make the model 'equation_v1' fit your data 'points_set' as closely as possible. Use the 'evaluate' method to evaluate your model's fit to the data.
