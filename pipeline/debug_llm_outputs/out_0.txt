Important notes:
The data shows a strong, consistent negative correlation between du/dt and du/dx.
The relationships are mostly linear with occasional variations that seem dependent
on 't', indicating a slight exponential or multiplicative nature.
Across different `t` values, the ratio of du/dt to du/dx remains relatively constant,
suggesting a trend toward a negative linear relationship.
For simplicity, a model du/dt = -c[0] * du/dx is hypothesized,
with 'c[0]' capturing the overall decay factor that is nearly uniform but
subtly adjusts with `t`. The negative sign highlights the decreasing nature of du/dt as du/dx increases.
The underlying trend reveals a stabilizing effect, as higher du/dx rates are met with proportionally greater
rates of decrease in du/dt, implying some form of dissipative mechanism in the system.
