Based on the data set provided, it appears that the derivative du/dt is solely a function of time, and not of x, u, or du/dx. However, since we must include at least one derivative in our function, let's assume that du/dt is directly proportional to the derivative du/dx. This results in a function of the form du/dt = k * du/dx, where k is a constant.

We can therefore write our function as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side =  params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = k * du/dx , k = c[0]"
    len_of_params = 1
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```
This function takes the derivative du/dx from derivs_dict, multiplies it by a parameter (k), and returns the right side of our equation, as well as a string representation of the equation and the length of the parameters.

Please note that this is assumed based on the available data, and might not always result in a perfect fit. The constant 'k' can be further optimized using minimization or other optimization techniques. And again, a more robust solution would depend on the underlying physics of the problem which is not explained here.
