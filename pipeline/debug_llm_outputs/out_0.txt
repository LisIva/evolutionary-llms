From the given data, it seems that the value of the derivative du/dt is determined by the value of du/dx, with a slight linear increment that depends on the time variable (t). The following function approximates the relationship in the data by proposing that du/dt is equal to some constant times the du/dx, but this constant gradually decreases linearly to -1 as time increases from 0 to 1.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    
    # linear decay factor 
    c = (-1.0) * t + 1.0
    right_side = c * right_side
    
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Please note that this function assumes the value of 'c' without fitting it over the data using optimization as done in the problem statement. This is because the current problem formulation does not contain enough dimensions (F(t, x, u, du/dx)) for learning such information from the data directly. Here the value of the decay factor 'c' is pre-defined. In real applications, one might use a more sophisticated nonlinear form for 'c' that can be learned from the data. Also, no fitting was done with parameters as they are merely multiplicative factors in this setup (for which the best fit could be anything around 1). This method solely focused on finding the dependency of the different variables which turned out to be a linear decay in 'c' with 't'. 

However, this is a simple example, and the relationship in your data may be more complex.

For the function defined in the answer the loss can be optimised further by having 'c' (the rate of decay) and 'decay_start_point' as parameters such that the decay starts more or less near 0 or even before, thus giving a better match near the beginning of the time spectrum.

The equation here is constructed in the form of du/dt = c * du/dx where c is a function of time. This is the simplest form that describes the data. From the minimal data we have at hand, we cannot deduce any complex behavior and hence the simplest assumption is that 'c' would be a linear function.

The function defined above in the answer gives the right side array with the equation output, a text-based representation of the equation, and the number of parameters used for obtaining the equation output. It essentially returns an approximation of the differential equation that can be fitted over the data. Here the equation is du/dx = c (which is a function of t) * du/dx where c is tuned over the time to replicate the trend present in the data.
