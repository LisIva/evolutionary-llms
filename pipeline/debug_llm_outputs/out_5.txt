Important notes:

A recent modeling attempt has introduced a novel relationship between du/dt, du/dx, and du/dt. The equation suggests that the rate of change of u over time (du/dt) is linearly dependent on both the change of u with respect to space (du/dx) and the product of du/dt and du/dx.

This reveals a reciprocal influence within the system: the change in u over time not only depends on its spatial gradient but also on the concurrent rate of its temporal change. The du/dt * du/dx term suggests a complex interaction, where the dynamic response of the function u is modulated by concurrent changes in space and time.

The parameters "c[0]" and "c[1]" define the strength and direction of these influences. "c[0]" quantifies the baseline effect of the spatial gradient on du/dt, whereas "c[1]" captures how the temporal change in u modulates this spatial influence.
