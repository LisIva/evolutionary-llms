Based on the exploration buffer, it seems that there might be an interaction between \(u\) and \(du/dx\), which was recently explored. Noticing there might be an increasing significance of the decrease of \(du/dt\) with the increase of \(u\) and \(du/dx\), it's seemly fruitful to explore higher-order terms or multiplicative interactions. As higher powers of \(u\) alone have been recently explored, we can look into multiplicative interactions involving \(du/dx\) and \(u\) in more complicated ways, specifically those not currently within the exploration buffer.

From a birds-eye perspective, an interaction of the second derivative of \(u\) with respect to \(x\) (i.e., \(du^2/dx^2\)) and \(u\) might bear significance. As higher powers of \(u\) alone have been recently explored, we can look into multiplicative interactions involving the derivative of \(u\) with respect to \(x\) and \(u\) itself or \(u^2\). From our current exploration buffer, introducing the product of the derivative and the variable to a power (e.g., \(du/dx\cdot u\)) represents a new exploration.

A possible structure is: \(du/dt = P_0\cdot (du/dx) + P_1\cdot (du/dx) \cdot u\).

This equation is still undeniable in its simplicity but concerns the interactions between the derivative and the variable itself, which represents a new exploration area regarding powers of \(u\) and its derivatives interaction.

The function will be constructed accordingly:

```python
def equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * u"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, 2
```

In the solution, \(P_0\) is the coefficient of the derivative \(du/dx\), which is directly included in an adjust equation forming the right-hand-side of the differential equation. \(P_1\) is the coefficient of the product of the derivative \(du/dx\) and the variable \(u\), representing the contribution of the interaction between the gradient and the variable intensity.

This choice allows exploration in the multiplicative interaction space between the derivative \(du/dx\) and the variable \(u\), strengthening the model's ability to capture more complex phenomena.
