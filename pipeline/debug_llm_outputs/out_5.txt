Based on the provided data points and the experimental buffer, it seems that the most used terms so far involve \( du/dx \). Given that we need to construct a function that heavily relies on a derivative and is not a simple copy of what we already have, letâ€™s try to construct something in this form:

\[ d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * t * (du/dx)^2 \]

This equation includes the derivative \( du/dx \), the variable \( u \), the variable \( t \), and the square of \( du/dx \). Importantly, this equation is not in the form of any previously evaluated equations in the experimental buffer.

Let's implement this suggested equation in the python code:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```
