Based on the provided data and the exploration buffer, a possible function could be du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du * du/dx.

In the equation, du/dt could be dependent on du/dx and also on their product, du*dudx, which would allow for exploring the interactions between u and du/dx to a higher degree.

Here is the python function corresponding to this solution:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
We have two parameters here (c[0] and c[1]) which would need to be optimized to fit the data using the minimize function. Parameter c[0] represents the direct influence of du/dx on du/dt and c[1] represents how u influences the interaction between du/dt and du/dx.
