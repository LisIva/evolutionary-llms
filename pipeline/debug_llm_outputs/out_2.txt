After examining the exp_buffer, we need to explore equations with different structures which involve the derivative 'du/dx'. The following equation has not been explored yet and it satisfies the mentioned requirements:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
