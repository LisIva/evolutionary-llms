After looking at the exp_buffer, it seems the equations d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] * (du/dx)^2 and d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u have been previously tried and assessed.

Given that, a possible new function could be:

d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u_x * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)^2

In this equation, as per the provided points_set, c[0] will be a constant coefficient, c[1] is the coefficient of the multiplication of 'u_x' and 'du/dx', and c[2] is the constant for the squaring of 'du/dx'.

Accordingly, the function equation_v1 would look like:

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
The coefficients (c[0] to c[2]) need to be determined through parameter optimization. This particular function imposes relationship between the second derivative of 'u' with respect to time, the first derivative of 'u' with respect to 'x', 'x', and the square of the derivative of 'u' with respect to 'x'.

The complexity of this equation is higher than previous tries, but it is yet a simplified version and it still fulfills the requirement of depending on at least one derivative ('du/dx'). It may also provide a more accurate result due to the increased complexity.

But to be precise, we would need to plug in the 't', 'x', 'u', and 'derivs_dict' values into 'equation_v1()' function, and find the 'params' which gives the lowest loss. Then substitute these obtained 'params' into the right_side variable of equation_v1(). As the number of parameters is 3 (c[0], c[1], c[2]), the len_of_params should be 3. The function 'evaluate()' helps checking whether the proposed equation meets the target. If it does not, we could continue tweaking 'equation_v1()' until a satisfactory equation is obtained. This can be a trial and error process depending on the problem. 

After all, we are aiming to find the best possible equation relating time 't', space 'x', and 'u' and its derivatives. This equation may not have an exact form, as it requires parameter optimization based on available data to acquire the most accurate structure.
