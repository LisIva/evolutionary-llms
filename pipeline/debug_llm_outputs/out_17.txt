To generate the function equation_v1, we must first look at the exp_buffer and avoid repeating the same formulas. We notice that the better scores contain du/dx and/or interactions with t or u. Some of the combinations also involve higher order derivatives (d^2u/dx^2 and d^3u/dx^3).

Given the instructives, we can try a model that includes the terms included in the equation_v0 (du/dx), while also introducing a new term that contains t and the third derivative to address a potential velocity gradient term (related to the change in du/dx with time). 

To avoid simply copying formulas from the exp_buffer, we can suggest an equation that hasn't been explored yet by the looks of it:

du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^3u/dx^3

This models the change of velocity as a combination of a linear response to du/dx (which we know is necessary from the previous attempts), and a term that combines time and third spatial derivative, which introduces a new dynamic of velocity decay with time that wasn't considered in previous attempts.

Let's define this equation in code:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["d^3u/dx^3"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * d^3u/dx^3"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation_suggest incorporates time and spatial derivative terms with physical meaning in fluid mechanics. The score of this equation_v1 will be evaluated via the evaluate function.

To present this answer I need to carefully explain how I've selected this equation: the motivation is based on the instruction to use at least one spatial derivative term (we took du/dx) and considering a term that hasn't been thoroughly explored yet (d^3u/dx^3) in the context of a possible physical process (velocity decay with time). This is novel and original while also attempting to improve upon previous scores (targeting <913, given the best score in the exp_buffer is 915). The evaluation of the score will now rest on the optimization of the function parameters (c[0] and c[1]) and how well it fits the points_set.
