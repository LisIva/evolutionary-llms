The given prompt suggests to create a function `equation_v1` which suggests a new equation for the given problem based on the data points `points_set` and the previous attempts stored in `exp_buffer`. Here is a possible completion of the function `equation_v1` based on the observation of those data:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * t * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The form of this equation was chosen considering the suggestions in the prompt, i.e., stating a simpler form and involving at least one derivative. This version of the equation is not yet included in the dict `exp_buffer` and doesn't copy any of the previous un-successful attempts. This response fits the requirements by suggesting a structure not yet explored, which is defined by an equation and the number of corresponding parameters.

Therefore, `equation_v1` suggests the following equation based on the data points and previous attempts:

\[
du/dt = c[0] \cdot du/dx + c[1] \cdot d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] \cdot t \cdot du/dx
\]
