Important notes:

The equation suggests a linear combination of the spatial gradient (du/dx) influenced by the parameter "c[0]", signifying its primary effect on the rate of change over time. Additionally, the impact of the spatial gradient appears to be modulated with time, as denoted by the "t" multiplier alongside "du/dx", controlled by parameter "c[1]".

This new equation advances the understanding that the temporal rate of change ('du/dt') is directly linked to the spatial gradient ('du/dx') and that this link becomes stronger or weaker over the time ('t'). The parameters "c[0]" and "c[1]" jointly reveal the spatial gradient's role with respect to time.
