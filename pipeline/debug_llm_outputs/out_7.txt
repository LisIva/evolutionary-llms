Let's represent the function in the form required:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * x * t * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

An important detail is to ensure that the number of evaluated parameters matches the one suggested. In the solution above we use two coefficients: 'c[0]' and 'c[1]', thus we have two parameters. This structure makes the solution consistent with the requirements set while making the problem statement and aligns with the minimal requirement of not copying equations from the exp_buffer.
