Here is a plausible function, based on the given conditions and exp_buffer, let us consider the equation: 

**d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * u * (du/dx)**

This function is not the same as the ones already in the buffer but bears semblance to them.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2 + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * u * (du/dx)"
    len_of_params = 3
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

Learning the exact structure of the equation might require more data points, better understanding of the phenomenon that generates this data, or more sophisticated methods for the symbolic regression. However, this is a plausible guess given the constraints and conditions in the problem. 

The term c[0] * du/dx equals the c[0] parameter multiplied by the derivative of u with respect to x (which fulfills the critical requirement that the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative). 

The (du/dx)^2 term is intended to capture any nonlinearities in the data.

The term c[2] * u * (du/dx) allows for a connection between the actual function value u and its derivative, potentially catching any complex dynamics not captured by simpler forms. 

Choosing the equation in this way is based on the fact that none of the existing equations in exp_buffer consider the multiplication of 'u' and 'du/dx' terms. Hence, it acts as a new guess. 

Make sure to replace 'params' with the output of the optimize function in your code, making this a well-functioning part of your overall symbolic regression algorithm.
