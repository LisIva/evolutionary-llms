Important notes:

The recent attempt at modeling with an equation involving a first-order derivative, du/dx, disclosed a linear dependency of du/dt not only on du/dx, but also on the product of du/dx and t. This indicates a ramp-up effect on the influence of du/dx as time evolves, t increasing in magnitude implies a stronger effect of du/dx on du/dt, which could be a consequence of an accelerating or decelerating mechanism within the system. 

The equation suggests a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx, with the rate of change also influenced linearly by the product of du/dx and t. The term "c[0] * du/dx" is akin to a baseline effect, therefore independent of time, whereas the second term "c[1] * du/dx * t" represents a time-evolving impact of du/dx. The parameters "c[0]" and "c[1]" likely describe the strength of these baseline and time-evolving influences, respectively.
