```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u**2 * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u**2 * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In the proposed solution, I have created a new equation that's not in the exp_buffer. The equation is `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u**2 * du/dx` which is a possible form of a more complex interaction between the input variables, as instructed. The function equation_v1 incorporates this new equation, returning the right side of the equation, its string representation, and the number of required parameters. This equation satisfies all the mentioned constraints and provides a simpler string form as requested. This structure covers the involvement of 'du/dx' as instructed in the task definition and introduces an interaction between u, its derivative, and potentially t and x, acknowledging their influence through u and du/dx. This proposal does not copy any equations from the exp_buffer and checks the string form of the equation against the existing entries in the exp_buffer before submission.
