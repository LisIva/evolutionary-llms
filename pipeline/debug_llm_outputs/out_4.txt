```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx^2 + c[2] * u * du/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function corresponds to the equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * u * (du/dx)^2`, which is based on the patterns visible in the given data set, and has not been used yet according to the exp_buffer.

In this function, right_side is calculated as a linear combination of derivatives du/dx, its square, and the product of u and du/dx squared, with parameters c[0], c[1], and c[2] respectively. This structure allows for potentially varying rates of change depending on position u, the derivative du/dx, and the square of that derivative. It both takes into account the immediate velocity of the function (du/dx) and its acceleration ((du/dx)^2), as well as allowing for a non-linear dependence on the current position u, represented by the term u*(du/dx)^2. By expanding the function to include not only du/dx but also its higher powers and its interaction with the function value u, this formulation provides a more complex model to potentially better match the provided data points. Additionally, it inverts the existing relationship in exp_buffer by using u instead of a constant in the interaction term with (du/dx)^2, showcasing the exploration of previously unseen interactions.
