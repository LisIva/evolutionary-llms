Important notes:
During our quest to find the perfect equation that fits the dataset, we extracted vital pieces of information that were instrumental in predicting the form of the new equation. The exploration in the exp_buffer led us to underscores the following observations:

i. We discovered that 't' not only plays a crucial role in the exponential relationship with 'du/dx' but also finds relevance in the linear context when it interacts directly with 'du/dx'.

ii. The intricacies within the data suggest that 'du/dx' itself, when squared, adds an extra non-linear dimension to the understanding of 'du/dt', reflecting a behavior that may be linked to more complex physical or mathematical phenomena.

iii. In addition to these findings, our new equation includes a term involving the product of 'u' with 'du/dx'. This term was introduced after observing the potential influence of the underlying process 'u' has on the relationship between 'du/dx' and 'du/dt', tentatively pointing to possible interaction effects within the data structure.

By leveraging these insights, the proposed new equation aims to more accurately describe the differential equation governing the process. It is hoped that this combined approach, combining both linear, exponential, and potential interaction effects, will provide a more comprehensive representation of the data's dynamics.
