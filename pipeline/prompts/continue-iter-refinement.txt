What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}' (note that u itself is a function of x and t)? Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
There is also an "Important notes" section that contains the most important information discovered about the equation. Refer to it and the experience buffer to suggest a new equation. Update the "Important notes" so that the other LLMs have better chance of discovering a new equation, but remember that the section can only contain up to 15 sentences.
Keep in mind that if you discard important info from the previous attempt, the future LLMs would NOT know it. Thus, keep or summarize PORTIONS of the info if it is deemed to be of utmost importance.
To summarize, you need to output 2 things - the code of equation_v1 AND the updated section of Important notes.

Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.

Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
3. Only give a simplified version of the equation in string_form_of_the_equation: always open the brackets, for ex. instead of 'du/dt = c[0] * (1 + du/dx) * t' return 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx * t'.

Important notes:
The ongoing pursuit for a comprehensive equation representation has revealed the importance of certain variables and their interactions for understanding 'du/dt'. Building upon the structural details from previous attempts, the following nuances have become apparent:

1. The proportional impact of 't' on 'du/dx' indicates a temporal dynamic between the variables.

2. The square of 'du/dx', when multiplied by 't', demonstrates a significant deviation in patterns from the dataset, hinting at a more intricate role of space differentiation in the equation's framework.

3. The product of 'du/dx' squared and 't' offers a perspective on the variance found across 't', with 'du/dt' potentially scaling differently over time. This reveals a more complex interplay between temporal and derivative effects, potentially capturing underlying nonlinearities.

4. The previous equation hints at a linear effect from 't' on 'du/dx', which, upon further analysis, identified a need for exploring the effect of 't' on squared 'du/dx'. This adjustment aims to better capture the intrinsic properties of the system in question.

The highlighted equation structure is an attempt to more effectively gauge the underlying dynamics while adhering to the principle of not overfitting the data. This iterative approach to combining linear and nonlinear relationships promises to elucidate more about the data's intrinsic complexities.
