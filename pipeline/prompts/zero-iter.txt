What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms, for ex., {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx) or {left_deriv} = F(du/dx). Suggest some simple structure, that roughly describe the relationships in data, for example {left_deriv} = c[0] * du/dx.
