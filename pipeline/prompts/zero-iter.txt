What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms, for ex., {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx) or {left_deriv} = F(du/dx). Suggest some simple structure, that roughly describe the relationships in data, for example {left_deriv} = c[0] * du/dx.
In the last section called "Important notes" write any important observations that could help other LLMs to complete the task of finding the equation. The observations must be concise and fit into 5-10 sentences. Example: "There appears to be close to linear connection between du/dt and du/dt with slight variations across different `t` and `x` values, suggesting a polynomial expression".

Important notes:
The overall trend in the data suggests an approximately linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
However, the rate at which du/dt changes with respect to du/dx seems to depend on the value of "t".
Specifically, for higher values of "t", the change appears to be more pronounced.
This indicates a potential exponential or multiplicative trend in the relationship.
To simplify, and taking into account the generally consistent sign and magnitude of change,
a simple relationship du/dt = -c * du/dx is proposed,
with "c" standing as a constant factor within the vicinity of the data.
This captures the dominant trend of a decaying du/dt with respect to du/dx,
with a factor that is almost, but not entirely, constant across different `t` values.
