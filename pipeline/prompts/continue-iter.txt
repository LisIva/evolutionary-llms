What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}' (note that u itself is a function of x and t)? Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
There is also an "Important notes" section that contains the most important information discovered about the equation. Refer to it and the experience buffer to suggest a new equation. Update the "Important notes" so that the other LLMs have better chance of discovering a new equation, but remember that the section can only contain up to 9 sentences.
To summarize, you need to output 2 things - the code of equation_v1 AND the updated section of Important notes.

Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.


Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
3. Only give a simplified version of the equation in string_form_of_the_equation: always open the brackets, for ex. instead of 'du/dt = c[0] * (1 + du/dx) * t' return 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx * t'.

Important notes:
The relationship between du/dt and du/dx seems to be most accurately described when considering the interaction with the variable t.
In the multiplicative form of du/dt = F(t, du/dx), 
the expression has a trend showing that du/dt is proportionally related to du/dx and more importantly is influenced 
by the value of t possibly demonstrating a decay or exponential-like relationship.
The multiplicative factor t affects the strength of the relation between du/dt and du/dx, 
highlighting the changing dynamic of du/dt relative to du/dx across the sampled "t" intervals.
This equation incorporates the dependence of du/dt on du/dx and "t", 
notably expanding on the previous suggestion to include a temporal factor for the influence of t on du/dt.
