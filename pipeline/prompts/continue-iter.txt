What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}' (note that u itself is a function of x and t)? Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
There is also an "Important notes" section that contains the most important information discovered about the equation. Refer to it and the experience buffer to suggest a new equation. Update the "Important notes" so that the other LLMs have better chance of discovering a new equation, but remember that the section can only contain up to 9 sentences.
To summarize, you need to output 2 things - the code of equation_v1 AND the updated section of Important notes.

Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.


Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
3. Only give a simplified version of the equation in string_form_of_the_equation: always open the brackets, for ex. instead of 'du/dt = c[0] * (1 + du/dx) * t' return 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx * t'.

Important notes:
The overall trend in the data suggests an approximately linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
However, the rate at which du/dt changes with respect to du/dx seems to depend on the value of "t".
Specifically, for higher values of "t", the change appears to be more pronounced.
This indicates a potential exponential or multiplicative trend in the relationship.
To simplify, and taking into account the generally consistent sign and magnitude of change,
a simple relationship du/dt = c * du/dx is proposed,
with "c" standing as a constant factor within the vicinity of the data.
This captures the dominant trend of a decaying du/dt with respect to du/dx,
with a factor that is almost, but not entirely, constant across different `t` values.
