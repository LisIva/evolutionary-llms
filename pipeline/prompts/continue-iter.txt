What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}'. Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by equation_v0.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.

Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
3. Only give a simplified version of the equation in string_form_of_the_equation: always open the brackets, for ex. instead of 'du/dt = c[0] * (1 + du/dx) * t' return 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx * t'.
