What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, that have the form of '{dots_order}'? Give an answer in the function equation_v1 constructing it in a way described by the example in the end.
Your goal is to explore the equations space (in relation to their scores) and to examine any inexplicit interactions between the input variables (for ex. du/dx * u^2).
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. Refer to it in order to understand what is yet to be explored and what might be worth more exploration. The best score is 0.
Also, keep in mind, if it seems like t or x are involved in the equation do not forget that u and its derivatives are dependent on them, and thus the involvement of t and x might be expressed through u or its derivatives. Your goal is to find any possible inexplicit interactions.
Start by exploring simpler structures and then gradually move on to more complicated ones IF you see the need to do so.

Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.

Requirements:
1. First look at the exp_buffer and then suggest the equation, the string form of which is not already there!
2. Do not copy the equations from the exp_buffer!
3. Only give a simplified version of the equation in string_form_of_the_equation: always open the brackets, for ex. instead of 'du/dt = c[0] * (1 + du/dx) * t' return 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx * t'.
