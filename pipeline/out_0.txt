Important notes:
The data presents a predominant linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx but observed changes in du/dt
with respect to du/dx are not constant. The values of du/dt increase in their absolute value
as the du/dx increases, albeit with some interdependence on 't' as well. For higher values of 't', the increase in the absolute value of du/dt with du/dx becomes more pronounced. This seems to indicate a possibly exponential scaling factor between 'du/dt' and 'du/dx', where 't' likely impacts this scaling factor. A simple relationship like du/dt = -c * du/dx is proposed to capture the core trend, where 'c' is a parameter indicating the rate of decay of 'du/dt' in response to an increase in 'du/dx'. While the structure might seem simplistic, it aptly serves as a first-order approximation given the observed data.
