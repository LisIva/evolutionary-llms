```python
# The function equation_v1 is designed to find a possible equation structure
# using the points_set data and avoiding previous structures stored in exp_buffer.

right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2

# Constructing the string representation of the equation
string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx + c[2] * u * (du/dx)^2"

len_of_params = 3

return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The function equation_v1 suggests a new form of structure for the differential equation, taking into account the 'du/dx', 't' and 'u' terms while avoiding duplicating previous attempts. It is constructed so as not to exactly replicate any form seen in exp_buffer. This new form adheres to the general form, where at least one derivative (du/dx) is included and other variables (t, u) are integrated in a non-trivial manner.
