The LLMs failed to suggest the form \(du/dt = u \cdot du/dx\) due to several reasons that are evident from the provided task details and the information about the attempts stored in the experience buffer (\(exp\_buffer\)). Here's why they failed and why guessing the true form straight from the data is challenging:

1. **Initial Focus on 'du/dx':**
The first attempt (0th iteration) identified a strong linear relationship between \(du/dt\) and \(du/dx\) with a slight deviation that suggested 't' could have an influence. This observation naturally led to an equation where \(du/dt\) was linearly dependent on \(du/dx\) as \(du/dt = -c \cdot du/dx\). This early direction set a precedence for neglecting 'u' and focusing on derivates.

2. **No Initial Inclusion of 'u' in Equations:**
The initial guess made no attempt to include 'u' in the equation despite 'u' being available in the data points. The LLM's attempts instead honed in on 'du/dx', 't', and 'x', adjusting for possible interactions and multiplicative factors but consistently not integrating 'u' in any basic form.

3. **Limited Benefit from Adding 'u':**
Subsequent iterations did not show significant improvement when directly incorporating 'u' into the equation forms proposed, as evident from the notes in the 5th iteration where 'u' failed to positively contribute to the fitting score. This might have been due to the dependency structure not being explicitly tuned to weigh 'u' correctly or because of misinterpretation about 'u's actual role.

4. **Focus on Linear Relationships:**
The coefficients and structures proposed by the LLMs were largely linear combinations. These linear models did not include 'u' explicitly, indicating a limitation in understanding the functional role of 'u' in the equation. Ignoring the non-linear dependencies between variables, such as multiplication of 'u' and 'du/dx', might have been why 'u' was repeatedly dismissed or not effectively considered in the equation structure.

5. **Bias to Simple Models:**
Occam's razor suggests that simpler models are more likely to be correct. The LLMs were inclined to advance simpler models over more complex forms, possibly overlooking the true form due to its non-linear complexity. This bias might have influenced their decisions to ignore 'u' as the addition of 'u' brings in an element of non-linearity that was not initially entertained.

6. **Experience Buffer Misled the Search:**
The \(exp\_buffer\) mostly indicated better results with interactions involving 't' and 'du/dx', 'x' and 'du/dx', and 't' alone compared to forms involving direct impacts of 'u'. This might have reinforced the direction to ignore 'u', steering the search towards combinations that scored better according to the \(exp\_buffer\).

In summary, the failure of other LLMs to guess the true form \(du/dt = u \cdot du/dx\) from the point set provided can be attributed to a combination of overemphasizing linear model simplicity, neglecting 'u' in the initial equation constructing phases, misvaluation of 'u' based on fitting scores, and consistent focus on 'du/dx' and its interactions, particularly with 't'. Ignoring the non-linear dependencies between variables, influenced by the \(exp\_buffer\) scores, ultimately led to overlooking the interaction between 'u' and 'du/dx' as the central aspect of the true equation's structure.
