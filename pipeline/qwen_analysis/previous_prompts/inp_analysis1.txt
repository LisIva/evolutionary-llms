I will provide a task description and the answers of other LLMs to that task. You will have to carefully analyze everything and answer the question in "## Question" section.

## Task description

What is a possible function with the general equation form {full_form} that could be described with the set of points named points_set, 
that have the form of '{dots_order}' (note that u itself is a function of x and t)? 
Give an answer in the function equation_v1.
The dictionary exp_buffer stores previous attempts to find the equation evaluated with evaluate function. 
While generating equation_v1 look at the exp_buffer and use the scores presented there to make a new guess about the equation structure. The best score is 0.
There is also an "Important notes" section that contains the most important information discovered about the equation. Refer to it and the experience buffer to suggest a new equation.

Note that although the general equation form is {full_form}, the resulting equation may take on simpler forms (BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!), 
like {left_deriv} = F(t, du/dx).
Make sure the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, so in the provided case du/dx must be included.

Important notes, 0th iter:
1. The relationship appears to be generally linear between du/dt and du/dx with a slight deviation that could suggest a multiplicative factor depending on the value of "t".
2. Given the consistency of the ratio between du/dt and du/dx across different data points, with a near-constant relationship yet slight variance with "t", it's practical to propose a relationship such as du/dt = -c * du/dx.
3. The coefficient 'c' can be estimated to be close to 1, reflecting the general trend from the data without considering the variance with "t", assuming simplicity and generalization, leading to an initial estimate of 'c' at 0.995.
4. This approximate relationship, despite ignoring the multiplicative effect of "t", effectively captures the core dynamic of the data, given that the rate of change in 'u' relative to 'x' (du/dx) is predominantly what influences du/dt, aside from slight variations attributable to "t".
5. The equation thus described is a straightforward linear relationship using 'du/dx' to predict 'du/dt', with a negative coefficient implying that 'du/dt' decreases as 'du/dx' increases, considering the negative trend observed in the data.

I. n., 1th iter:
1. Prior exploration suggested a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx with a constant multiplicative factor. 
2. The proposed equation includes a modified component accounting for potential t-dependence of the relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
3. A notable trend indicating that the relationship might not be purely constant across t suggests the need for an additive term that scales with t and du/dx.
4. Initial exploration in the buffer indicates a strong correlation between du/dt and du/dx, but does not fully account for the role of t.
5. This adjusted representation aims to accommodate how du/dt changes with du/dx and by what factor this relationship is influenced by t.
6. The coefficients 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are required to quantify the core relationship and the t-dependent variation respectively.
7. The adjustment explicitly acknowledges t's influence without overcomplicating the model, focusing on the detected variations.
8. The intent is to provide a more accurate description of how du/dt evolves with du/dx and how the variable t could influence this evolution.
9. The general form ensures it can encompass a wider range of the dynamic behavior depicted in the dataset.
10. The linear terms included here both address the primary influence of du/dx on du/dt and the potential modulation of this relationship by t.
11. Further refinement could include more complex t-dependencies but is initially left simple following Occam's Razor.

I. n., 2d it.:
1. Preliminary analysis showed that the change rate du/dt is closely linked with the derivative du/dx.
2. The introduced equation explores the hypothesis that du/dt might depend on both du/dx and x, indicating a spatially variant rate of change.
3. By including an x-factor multiplying du/dx, the proposed model explores how the relationship between du/dt and du/dx changes spatially.
4. This modification offers a structured way to account for any potential spatial effects on the relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
5. The role of 'x' in the equation emphasizes the possible impact of spatial dimensions on the evolutionary behavior of du/dt.
6. Such consideration could reflect underlying physical or system properties that vary with x.
7. The coefficients 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are to be tuned to accurately capture these physical properties.
8. The initial feedback indicates that a linear dependence on du/dx does not fully capture the dataset's nuances, suggesting sophistication.
9. Empirical observations indicate that there might be an underlying functional relationship involving both du/dx and x.
10. The relation with 'x' is introduced to better align with observations by considering the spatial dimension's potential influence on du/dt.
11. This alteration casts light on how spatial variables influence du/dt and opens up new avenues for granular analysis of system dynamics.

I. n., 3d it.:
1. The dynamics of du/dt appear to be a function of du/dx, t, and x, each domain element playing a distinctive role.
2. Incorporating 't' into the equation extends the modeling scope to include temporal effects that might influence the du/dt evolution.
3. By adding a dependency on 't*x', the hypothesis of time-space interaction affecting the change rate du/dt is tested.
4. The introduction of 't*x' indicates a potential synergy between the spatial and temporal domains impacting du/dt.
5. The role of 't' in conjunction with 'x' suggests a scenario where the effect of space on du/dt changes with time.
6. This setup potentially reveals underlying mechanisms that dynamically vary over the temporal and spatial fields.
7. The incorporation of a time-dependent factor addresses a key aspect neglected in previous models, suggesting sophisticated dynamics.
8. The coefficients 'c[0]', 'c[1]', and 'c[2]' indicate a complex interaction that needs tuning to properly fit the data.
9. Observations imply that the relationship between du/dt and the environment might be more intricate than previously assumed linear dependencies.
10. The modified hypothesis incorporates time as a variable, offering a more sophisticated model to envelop the entire dataset's variance.

I. n., 4th it.:
1. du/dt seems to have a direct relationship with du/dx, suggesting a significant interaction between slope and time derivative.
2. The inclusion of 'x * du/dx' highlights the spatial influence on the change rate, indicating a possible spread effect.
3. The dependency on 't' emphasizes the temporal dimension, possibly accounting for decay or accumulation effects as time progresses.
4. Combining 't' and 'x * du/dx' reveals a more nuanced model, which might capture the interaction between spatial slope slopes and temporal dynamics.
5. The 't' term is expected to capture temporal trends, providing insights into how du/dt behaves over time without needing space interaction.
6. This formulation considers distinct temporal and spatial effects separately and introduces an interaction component for deeper understanding.
7. The relationship between du/dt and its predictors appears complex, suggesting non-linear interactions and possibly external factors not included in this model.
8. The coefficients 'c[0]', 'c[1]', and 'c[2]' allow for nuanced tuning, offering a flexible framework that may adapt to different types of data distributions.
9. The equation now adjusts previous assumptions by acknowledging the multifaceted nature of du/dt dynamics within the analyzed data points.
10. The latest form tackles issues raised by discrepancies in model predictability by expanding the space-time interaction hypothesis, contributing to clearer interpretations.
11. The introduction of x * du/dx might help in explaining the spatial dynamics of the field beyond the restriction isolated to the temporal factor, potentially recognizing multi-directional influences.

I. n., 5th it.:
The exploration of potential equation forms has revealed that directly involving 'u' seems to not contribute positively to the fitting score, indicating that the true equation might not directly depend on 'u' but on its derivative 'du/dx' instead. The best fitting equations found so far always include 'du/dx', implying that changes in 'u' with respect to 'x' carry critical information for the equation's structure. Simultaneously, including both 't' and 'x' in relation to 'du/dx' has shown the highest potential for accurately capturing the dynamic behavior represented by the dataset. Considering how time and distance ('t' and 'x') influence 'du/dx' can possibly reveal the underlying physical or mathematical principles governing the data's evolution. 

I. n., 6th it.:
Previous attempts have shown that 'u' does not directly contribute to the equation structure, indicating the primary dependence on 'du/dx'. The inclusion of both 't' and 'x' alongside 'du/dx' has proved beneficial for fitting the equation to the dataset. The updated structure includes 't' and 'x' explicitly, aiming to understand their independent and combined effects on 'du/dx'. This equation form preserves the observed dependencies while introducing new structural elements that might reveal additional insights into the data's underlying dynamics. By keeping 'du/dx' as a part of the equation, the focus remains on understanding the rate of change in 'u' with respect to 'x'. The direct inclusion of 't' and its interaction with 'x' via 'du/dx' aims to better capture the temporal and spatial influences on this rate of change. This structure could potentially reflect more complex interactions at play in the data. Note that the updated equation still anchors on 'du/dx', maintaining consistency with previous scores, which highlighted its significance. The linear combination in the right-hand side with 'c[1] * t' introduces a novel aspect compared to the previous boosting patterns, focusing on the time's role independently before considering its potential interaction with space ('x') through 'du/dx'. Remembering that the best score so far focused on a tripartite relationship between 'du/dx', 't', and 'x', this expanded approach might open new avenues for data fitting while staying consistent with the preceding observations. It's also noteworthy that 'x' manifests both in a direct pairing with 't' and via 'du/dx', aiming to separate spatial impacts from those based on instantaneous change in 'u' with respect to 'x'. This design hypothesis explicitly tests how time ('t') and space ('x') in concert with 'du/dx' might govern the evolution of 'u', building on insights from earlier successful equation forms. All these elements combine to propose an equation that is not only in conversation with prior attempts but iterates forward, aiming for a deeper understanding of the dataset's underlying principles.

I. n., 7th it.:
1. The best approach so far averages a score of 96.0, closer to 0 is better.
2. Trial fits that incorporated factors like 't' and both 't' and 'du/dx' have shown to yield the best results.
3. Introducing a product of time and position 't*x' in conjunction with the derivative 'du/dx' doesn't seem to perform as well as including 't' alone.
4. Derivatives 'du/dx' have been consistently included in the equations, implying it holds substantial information about the system's dynamics.
5. Higher scoring configurations have typically involved both 'du/dx' and 't', indicating the importance of time-varying effects.
6. The initial set involving 'du/dx' and 't' was very competitive.
7. There's suggestion of an interaction between 't' and 'du/dx', but 't*x' was not as successful.
8. Scores obtained from combinations involving multiple derivatives, 't', and 'x' showed a variety in performance, with 't' and 'du/dx' combinations leading to the best models.
9. An interesting finding was that 'du/dt' did not need to be directly included in the equations to achieve a competitive score.
10. This pursuit is about finding the most relevant aspects of 't', 'x', and derivatives without simplifying to a form that makes the equation overly straightforward. 
11. Introducing a product of time and derivative 't*du/dx' was a fruitful direction.
12. Simplifying equations to linear forms with derivative 'du/dx' while including 't' has proven to be beneficial.
13. Attempts to include 'x' directly in the equations with time 't' have not matched the performance of 't' alone.
14. The relationship between 't' and 'du/dx' is significant, suggesting there is underlying dynamics that these variables capture effectively.
15. The score evaluation method prefers equations that balance the relevance of 't', 'x', and derivatives, rather than weighing one factor heavily over others.

## end of LLMs' output

Note: the 'exp_buffer' variable was growing gradually at each iteration and thus the LLM on 0th iter didn't have an access to any value in exp_buffer and etc.

## Question:

Knowing that the true equation, to which points_set is the solution, has the form du/dt = u * du/dx can you tell me why the other LLMs failed to suggest such a form? Is it very hard to guess from the data? As far as I can see, the LLMs even dismissed the very possibility of "u" being a part of the equation.
