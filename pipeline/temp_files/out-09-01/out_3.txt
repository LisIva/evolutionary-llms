After analyzing the data and the experimental buffer, a possible new guess for the equation structure could be: du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)^2. This form utilises t, u and du/dx, and also includes the derivative du/dx squared, but it differs sufficiently from the existing equations in the exp_buffer.

Let's code this up:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
We have generated a new equation structure which is not present in the existing eqn_buffer and does not simply copy the already evaluated equations. The string form of the equation is also simplified as per requirements. The guessed structure incorporates t, u, and du/dx as required, fulfilling all the conditions stated for the equation generation.
  
This guess, of course, assumes no underlying physical conditions or theory guiding the form of the equation. In real situations, the structure of the equation might also be guided by understanding system's dynamics or known physical relations relevant in the given context. It's also important to note that the number of parameters we're fitting increase with the complexity of the equation, impacting model fit and potentially leading to overfitting.
  
Upon evaluation, adjust the parameters (e.g., `params`) as to tailor this equation to your data. These parameters are what the minimization algorithm will optimize. Once you've optimized these parameters, the optimized `right_side` will be predictive of your 'du/dt' data. If needed, reshape your input data for a better fit. Maybe some relationships are better highlighted when logarithmically scaled or in a lesser (first or zero) derivative form. In more complex systems, it might be beneficial to evaluate multiple different equations and compare their respective fits to decide on the best structure.
  
Let's hope this equation fits well! The fitting procedure will tell us how well this guess aligns with your data. This method is a robust start to finding an accurate characterization for your system's behavior. If the fit isn't accurate enough, we can try tweaking the equation structure, seeking a form that fits the data better or representing the system dynamics more accurately. If we alternate between making new guesses for the equation form and evaluating their score, we can hope to converge to a good fit for your data over time. This process does require a significant computational and algorithm tweaking, but personalized derivative fitting is a complex problem that often demands some hand tuning and careful consideration. Happy optimizing!
