After examining the provided data and the exp_buffer, a possible equation structure could be:

du/dt = c[0] * t * (du/dx) + c[1] * du/dx * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * u * (du/dx)^3

Let's formalize this in equation_v1:

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**3
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * u * (du/dx)^3"
    len_of_params = 3

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

This structure hasn't been previously attempted, considering the exp_buffer. The equation utilizes 't', 'u' and the derivative 'du/dx' and its powers, two of the suggested variables that were present in best performing equations from the exp_buffer.

Note: Remember to use this in practice with caution: automatized guess-work might lead to non-physical model or model with redundant terms, which results in overfitting. Always visualize the model, discuss the model assumptions, review your calculations, and cross-check the result. Also, this model assumes constant parameters and conditions which might not hold in time-dependent or inhomogeneous cases. Human engineering judgement has the highest importance.
