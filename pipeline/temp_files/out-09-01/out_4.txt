Based on the evaluation scores in `exp_buffer`, it seems reasonable to incorporate various terms involving higher powers of derivatives and combinations thereof. Since past attempts with relatively low scores suggested including `u`, `du/dx` and its various powers, another attempt can integrate these components similarly but with added complexity. Looking at the exp_buffer, previous equations did have terms involving cubic powers of `(du/dx)`, terms involving `du/dx^2`, combinations of `du/dx * u`, among others. Keeping these trends while introducing a minimal new term — for instance combining `u^2` multiplied by `t` and multiplied by `(du/dx)`, could allow for an adaptive fit.

Now, the novel equation can therefore be something in the form such as:
du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^3 + c[1] * du/dx^2 + c[2] * u^2 * (du/dx) * t + c[3] * u * du/dx,

which incorporates derivatives, powers and products in creative ways. Ensuring the introduced equation isn’t already present (and considering to avoid duplicacy), here goes the code block:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    """
    This new equation integrates prior successful patterns to incorporate cubic derivations,
    quadratic derivations, and combined terms of original function u,
    time-dependency t into the derivative.

    Equation will be of format:
    du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^3 + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * t * u**2 * (du/dx) + c[3] * u * du/dx
    Note: We specifically ensure to contain at least cubic and quadratic aspects of the dx derivative,
          as well incorporating the function term u, plus its time scaling.
    """

    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 3
    right_side += params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2 
    right_side += params[2] * t * (u ** 2) * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    right_side += params[3] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] 

    # The string description of the actual equation.
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^3 + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 " + \
                              "+ c[2] * t * (u^2) * du/dx + c[3] * u * du/dx"

    # Length parameter array required - here we anticipate 4 required parameters.
    len_of_params = 4

    # Return the appropriate components as directed.
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This formula should satisfy requirement of using and expanding upon knowledge from `exp_buffer` along with including aspects of the du/dx from the dataset analysis.
