To generate a function based on the given set of points and the general form of the equation, let's first observe some patterns and consider the previous attempts stored in `exp_buffer`. The previous best guess was:
```
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * (du/dx)^2 + c[2] * (du/dx)^3
```
with a score of 6.0. This suggests that a cubic function of `du/dx` was considered but didn't perform exceptionally well. We can likely do better.

Taking a look at the trends in the data, especially `du/dt` over `du/dx`, there appears to be a linear relationship (or something close to linear) with slight variations across different `t` and `x` values, suggesting a polynomial expression might be worth exploring.

While polynomial functions are simple, we can try to model with more specific behaviors, e.g., adding a term that represents specifically the change across `t` (which is simply multiplication by `t`) or specific interaction with `du/dx` - this could be a linear, quadratic, or cubic interaction. Let's propose a function equation that incorporates these variables but avoids directly replicating the previous attempts from `exp_buffer`.

### New Equation Suggestion: `equation_v1`

We'll test an option that accounts for the linear behavior of `du/dx` with some consideration for `u` and the time `t`:
```
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * t * (du/dx)^2
```
The rationale for the equation is two-fold: admitting linear influence of `du/dx` (via `c[0]`) while suggesting that both the current value `u` and the time `t` might refine that influence (via `c[1]` and `c[2]` respectively), including presence of second derivative term with `t` wrapping, indicating non-trivial temporal effects on how `du/dt` responds to `du/dx`.

### Implementation

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]) + (params[1] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]) + (params[2] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2))
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u * du/dx + c[2] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Parameter Explanation

- `c[0]` scales the rate of change in `u` caused by the derivative `du/dx`.
- `c[1]` weighs the current `u` in respect to `du/dx`, allowing for an interaction effect reminiscent of nonlinear dynamics.
- `c[2]` imbues the equation with a time component, where the multiplication with `t` allows for accumulation or deceleration as time passes, modifying the change in `u` based on the square of `du/dx`.

This proposed equation retains the linear term `du/dx` as observed in the problem statement and utilizes the full set of provided variables in a novel way that diverges from previous attempts, aligning with the guidance to not merely copy from `exp_buffer` but use its contents to generate a fresh hypothesis with a reasonable score.
