To complete the task as per the instruction, we can consider a differential equation that is a function of `du/dx` and additional terms. Given the requirements and the previous attempts, let's avoid just simple terms like `du/dx` and instead include terms such as `du/dx` raised to some power combined with spatial and temporal variables `t` and `x`.

However, let's ensure the equation includes `du/dx` as per requirement and is also not directly present in the `exp_buffer`. Based on the previous attempts and their scores in the `exp_buffer`, none of them includes `du/dx` to some power (e.g., `du/dx` squared) in combination with spatial and temporal variables. So, we can construct the equation as such:

### Equation Suggestion:

If in `equation_v0` we had `d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx`, and this seems naive because it directly proportional to `du/dx`, we can consider adding powers and spatial/temporal factors to create a more complex equation. For instance, let's consider:

`d^2u/dt^2 = c[0]*x*du/dx + c[1]*t^2*(du/dx)^2`

The proposed model attempts to include both temporal and spatial variations along with the effect of `du/dx`, which is required by the task. It also introduces nonlinearity (since `du/dx` is squared) to capture more complex dependencies. The influence of `t` and `x` are included through multiplication with `du/dx` and `t^2`.

### Code Completing:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * (t**2) * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0]*x*du/dx + c[1]*t^2*(du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = len(params)
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

### Advantage of the New Suggestion:

1. **Nonlinearity**: Using `du/dx` squared captures potential nonlinear effects that could exist in the underlying data.
2. **Temporal-Spatial Significance**: It includes the effects of both `t` and `x` and potentially how `du/dx` varies in space and with time.
3. **Complexity and Heterogeneity**: It tries to capture more complex interactions between derivatives and spatiotemporal variables unlike simple linear relationships.

The form of the eqn (with the coupling of `du/dx`, `x`, and `t`) provides a systematic way of considering non-trivial interactions in the data.

This equation meets the stated criteria of being different from what is presented in the `exp_buffer`, using `du/dx` (which is required), and is not a direct copy of anything attempted previously, which was within simple linear terms in the `exp_buffer` with just `du/dx`.
