Based on the input data and looking at the exp_buffer, we haven't worked with an equation form that includes any terms beyond du/dx in the determination of d^2u/dt^2. Let's start by proposing an equation form that includes a term dependent on x, as the influence of x on the second derivative d^2u/dt^2 is yet to be investigated.

Let's consider an equation form where d^2u/dt^2 depends on both du/dx and x. The parameters are as follows:
- c[0] would be the coefficient multiplying du/dx.
- c[1] would be the coefficient multiplying x.
- c[2] would be a constant term.

The equation would resemble: "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * x + c[2]"

Let's complete the function equation_v1.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x + params[2]
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1]*x + c[2]"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In this suggested equation, u is constrained by the second derivative d^2u/dt^2 being determined by the first derivative of u with respect to x (du/dx) multiplied by the first coefficient (c[0]), the position (x) multiplied by the second coefficient (c[1]) and a constant term (c[2]). The equation has 3 parameters to be optimized.
