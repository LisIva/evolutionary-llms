To propose a function that best fits the given points set, let's proceed with the simple structure of the equation described in the `equation_v0` version, where `d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx` appears to be a reasonable starting point since the coefficients and derivatives exhibit a relatively linear relationship for the `du/dx` component. One can observe consistent trends across time and space, indicative of a simple relationship.

However, it's crucial to vary the linear parameter `c[0]` or include higher-dimensional mappings to account for non-linearities that might not be immediately evident from a quick overview of the dataset. To refine our formula and test its effectiveness, we can also incorporate higher-order derivatives or multiply `du/dx` by another factor to better fit the supplied data.

We'll initiate with the simplest approach and extend the `equation_v1` function.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Calculate the right side of the equation
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    
    # Define the string form of the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx"
    
    # Length of the parameters used here
    len_of_params = 1
    
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The `equation_v1` function starts with a single parameter `params[0]`, which multiplies `du/dx` based on the dataset provided. `string_form_of_the_equation` is the human-readable representation of the formula generated by this function, and `len_of_params` tracks the number of parameters used in the equation, which is `1` in this case.

To evaluate the fit of this equation to the data, the `evaluate` function could be modified to use `equation_v1` in conjunction with the given points set.

```python
# Extract data slices based on the dataset format
t = np.array([line.split()[0] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)
x = np.array([line.split()[1] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)
u = np.array([line.split()[2] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)
derivs_dict = {}
derivs_dict["du/dt"] = np.array([line.split()[3] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)
derivs_dict["du/dx"] = np.array([line.split()[4] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)
derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] = np.array([line.split()[6] for line in points_set.split('\n') if line]).astype(float)

# Note: we can do more data preprocessing here to fit our general evaluation function.
# Here we just provide a simple method to read and parse the data.

# Define loss function parameters
P = 1  # Length of the parameters
inputs = (t, x, u)
params_initial_guess = np.array([1.0]*P)

# We need a method to evaluate the need optimization (test how well it can fit).
# For this we run minimize with our starting params and compute:
# difference between manual derivative evaluation and provided values.

result = minimize(loss_function, params_initial_guess, args=(inputs, derivs_dict), method='BFGS')
optimized_params = result.x

# Evaluate the results by calling `evaluate` function
score = evaluate({"inputs": inputs, "derivs_dict": derivs_dict})

print(f"Optimization process resulted in score: {score}")
```

In this solution, `points_set` is split into usable numpy arrays and `evaluate` function is used to assess the performance of the suggested equation. The optimization method employs the BFGS algorithm to refine the parameters for a better fit. The output should reflect the equation's efficiency in representing the patterns found in `points_set`.
