Based on the provided exp_buffer and given requirements, we suggest an equation that involves the derivative du/dx. Ignoring the previous attempts in exp_buffer, we construct a new equation.

Taking the derivatives and variables into account, a tentative equation could be: d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * (du/dx)^2, however, this equation has already been presented with a score of 983 in the exp_buffer, so we need to find a different approach. 

After analysing the data set, you can observe that the evolution of d^2u/dt^2 is closely tied to the product of x and du/dx. The equation could take the form of d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx.

Since du/dx appears as a common term in such an equation and it is required by the task, we choose this as our approach.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * x * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
This function multiplies the derivative du/dx with the constant c[0] and the product of x and du/dx with the constant c[1], then adds them to create the predicted right side of the equation d^2u/dt^2. The equation itself is returned as a string form, and the number of parameters expected by the equation is also returned. Please note that this is not a replication of any equation from exp_buffer but a fresh proposal following the task requirements.
