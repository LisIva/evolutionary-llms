To propose a new equation based on the `exp_buffer`, we need to take into account the prior attempts. In this case, we want to avoid simple direct multiplication of the derivative `du/dx` with constants or simple variable terms since those forms have already been explored.

Given that `d^2u/dt^2` has been predicted using linear, quadratic, and constant relationships with `du/dx`, we can consider a higher-order polynomial or a trigonometric function. However, the simplest and most effective approach for this context may be to consider a term that involves the derivative `du/dx` in a more complex expression. For variety and to avoid suggestions already in `exp_buffer`, I will propose a function which includes `du/dx` relating to both `t` and `x` in a multiplicative form, with each having an exponent, and multiplying it with `du/dx`. This creates a dependency that `exp_buffer` does not already cover.

### Constructed function

We would define an equation of the form:
\[d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx * (t**c[1]) * (x**c[2]).\]
A reasonable thought for adding differentiability could be the inclusion of higher derivative terms. However, by the problem's requirement, we need to construct a new function taking into account a derivative term (`du/dx`), and ensure its string representation is absent from `exp_buffer`. This function meets all these requirements.

### `equation_v1` Implementation

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = (derivs_dict["du/dx"]) * t ** params[1] * x ** params[2] * params[0]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx * t**(c[1]) * x**(c[2])"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

In this correction, I've defined `equation_v1`. According to the described conditions and parameters distribution, we get an equation not found in `exp_buffer` that takes into account `du/dx`, as expressed in its string form and additional parameters. This completes the desired 'equation_v1'.
