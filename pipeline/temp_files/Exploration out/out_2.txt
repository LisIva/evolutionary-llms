Based on the provided points_set and the example, we can see that the form of the equation will include du/dx, u, t, and some constants (c). Looking at the exp_buffer, it suggests we have tried equations involving the multiplication of du/dx with t and u. We observe a high score for an equation with du/dx and u, indicating there is potentially a strong relation between these.

Given the high score for the equation 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx', it suggests perhaps a linear relationship between du/dt and time (t) when considering the du/dx term, but we still have a relatively high score (though not best), for 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx'.

Exploring this uncertainty, we might speculate on a response to time (t) with a feedback-like relation involving the intermediate state through u, and an explicit interaction that could be seen through du/dx.

To propose a slightly different form which introduces a coupled interaction that draws from these insights, while still ensuring that the equation structure is not simply a restatement of any tried before, consider:

The du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx) dependence on at least one derivative (du/dx) is solidified. However, looking for an additional coupling term, we may explore interactions that have not been explicitly successful yet, but seem worth investigating. Borrowing information from the data set and ensuring we aren't restating any equation from the exp_buffer, the following guess could be:
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] - params[2] * u
    P = 3 # Three parameters are needed for optimizing
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx - c[2] * u"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, P

```

Deriving from the example's given equations and the transformed points_set, a contrarian and non-trivial guess of the equation structure should contain du/dx and potentially feature a du/dx squared term, adding a non-linear component of time (t), the current solution state (u), assuming an opposing force or decay represented by c[2] * u.

This approach aligns with the instruction to suggest the equation by looking at exp_buffer. Here, we are suggesting the inclusion of an additional du/dx squared term to represent a potential exponential growth (or diffusion-like process). We are also maintaining a term linear in t and du/dx (seen to have a low score indicating a potential good fit) while introducing a parameter that potentially scales u to signal a counteracting or competing factor in the evolution of u over time.

Note that the exponents 2, 1, and the negative sign are chosen here as an example extrapolation that maintains the question's requirements and excludes direct repetition from the exp_buffer. The exact coefficients (c[0], c[1], c[2]) will be determined by the optimization process depending on the data's behavior and this speculative model structure. The chosen structure, "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx - c[2] * u", thus appropriately constructs an equation that adheres to the constraints provided and is different (in terms of structure and variable usage) from what has already been tried.
