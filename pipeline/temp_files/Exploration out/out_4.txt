After analyzing the data and the exp_buffer, let's construct a new equation v1 that hasn't been tried yet, considering our observations.

First, we notice that 'du/dt' is strictly decreasing with 't', implying that the response might be directly proportional to 't'. However, 'du/dt' remains unchanged when 'u' and 'du/dx' reach zero, suggesting that both 'u' and 'du/dx' should participate in determining 'du/dt'.

The previous attempts included 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx', which scored 2.0, giving insight into the potential form, with 'du/dt' showing linear dependence with 't' and 'du/dx' and exponentially decreasing with 'u' as 'u' approaches zero.

Additionally, 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * du/dx ** 2 + c[2] * t', scored slightly lower, indicating that dependence on 'du/dx' can be non-linear. 

However, our previous equation attempts did not consider interactions between 't' and the other variables. Moreover, we notice that as 'u' and 'du/dx' approach zero, 'du/dt' becomes negative longer than the influence of 't' might suggest. This could mean 't' is not solely contributing linearily to the decrease of 'du/dt'.
Noting that the value of 'du/dt' massively changes when 'du/dx' changes from 0 to positive numbers, and knowing that the bigger the 'du/dx', the faster the increase of 'du/dt', which might suggest that 'du/dt' could be dependent on 'du/dx^2'.

Given these considerations, we can opt to formulate a new equation that considers a second-order dependence on 'du/dx^2' and introduces a negative non-linear influence of 'u' on 'du/dt', and further, given 'du/dt' approaches -1 as 't' gets to 1, we can infer the need for a term that captures this pattern regarding 't'. 

Therefore, the proposed equation could be structured in the form: 'du/dt = c[0] (du/dx**2 + c[1] * u**2) - c[2] * (u**c[a] * du/dx) + c[3]* t**c[b]'. However, this form is overly complex and includes terms ('t**c[b]' and 'u**c[a]', specifically) that might severely hamper gradient estimation for our parameter optimization process.

To construct our new guess, we will go for a slightly more innovative form while still dependent on 'du/dx, u,' and 't' including their relationship with 'du/dt.' 

Example: 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx ** 2 + c[1] * t * du/dx**c[2] - c[3] * u', where 'c[2]' should be in the range of [0, 1] to model the non-linearity of the relationship.

Thus, we obtain the following equation v1:

```python

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2 + params[1] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** params[2]) - params[3] * u
    P = 4 # Four parameters are needed for optimizing
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx) ** 2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx) ** c[2] - c[3] * u"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, P
```
In this function, du/dx is squared in the first term to emphasize the effect of the rate of change of u with respect to x, and the third term introduces a negative influence of the current value of 'u' on the overall change rate of 'u', capturing the trend towards zero as 'u' approaches it. The coefficient 'c[2]' could potentially capture the non-linear decreasing rate of 'du/dt' as 'du/dx' increases.

Note that 'c[2]' is part of the adjustable parameters (params) and its range of values should be considered when running the optimization process, meaning it could potentially take on non-integer values to allow the function to fit any non-linear decreasing trend of 'du/dt' with 'du/dx' as explained. While the constraint 'c[2] in range [0,1]' or 'c[2] > 0' could be posed, an unconstrained optimization process should first determine if initial guesses of '1.0' or '0.5' are acceptable. However, as noted by our discussion, bounds such as 'c[2] in [0.1, 1]' may work better initially while gauging the performance of this function.
In summary,

1. 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx ** 2' accounts for the observed increase of 'du/dt' with 'du/dx', especially for the bigger 'du/dx' values.
2. 'du/dt = c[1] * t * du/dx ** c[2]' accounts for that 'du/dt' decreases with 't' and has a strong dependence on 'du/dx', while having the possibility to be non-linear.
3. 'du/dt = c[3] * u' accounts for that 'du/dt' grows more negative as 'u' grows smaller and gains even more negativity as 'u' tends to 0.

Strict Constraints
- 'c[2]' should be non-negative.
- The equation is dependent on a quadratic term of both 'du/dx' and 'u' (making 'du/dt' primarily sensitive to 'du/dx').
- All parameters play a distinguishable role in determining 'du/dt'. 

However, please take note that no definite interpretation can be guaranteed from this new equation v1, as it relies on fitting the parameters and identifying patterns that are statistically valid but not known beforehand. The effects of 'du/dx', 'u', and the relationships between them and 'du/dt' are not clear from the provided data alone. This suggested equation v1 is a new attempt reflective of what we've observed based on our current knowledge of the data, and may not accurately represent the underlying model that generated the 'du/dt' given the 't', 'x', 'u', 'du/dx'. Additional cross-validation or more theoretical understanding about the nature of the relationship between 'du/dx', 'u', and 'du/dt' can give more insights and suggest additional or different terms to be included in the equation v1.

Nonetheless, by enforcing the relationship "du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)^c[2] - c[3] * u", we add a term that captures how 'du/dt' behaves differently for small compared with large 'du/dx' values, which is a step towards understanding the underlying dynamics. The sign of the 'u' term is also accounted for, explicitly recognizing that 'du/dt' tends to decrease more negatively as 'u' tends to zero.
To summarize, we've looked at the mechanics of the data (negative 'du/dt' for the given parameters), and joined them with the previous equation attempts and its scores, leading to the formulation of the equation, 'du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)^c[2] - c[3] * u' as a potential form for the underlying system, which is a different structure from any previously attempted model as required and directly tackles the issues discussed from the data.
This concludes the analysis and formulation of an equation, in line with the guideline to provide a simplified equation structured differently from any identical equation previously evaluated, taking into account that at least one derivative of the function must be included in the structure. As instructed, we simply applied 'du/dx' in the equation, uncoupled it explicitly from the other derivative 'du/dt' and avoided any pure-zero term in the structure to meet the derivative inclusion criterion.
Given the task and data constraints, the values have been selected and presented in the simplified structure as defined in the guidelines; the equation is distinct from those already evaluated, and should allow for parameter optimization with the given data, fulfilling the task requirements as specified.
Remember to use the 'evaluate' function to check if such a constructed equation could efficaciously represent the underlying system, indicated by a low score or error.
If the constructed equation has a low loss score, it is potentially a good approximation of the underlying system and may be used for future data points.
So, the generated equation could be, in our case: 'du/dt = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * t * (du/dx)^c[2] - c[3] * u' to model the underlying system in an uncoupled fashion explicitly recognizing the influence of derivatives 'du/d
