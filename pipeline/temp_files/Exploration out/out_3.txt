After looking at the input data and the exp_buffer, I suggest the following form of the equation. Based on the previous attempts in the exp_buffer, the terms involving 'du/dt', 'du/dx', 't', and 'u' have been tested. Considering that we now should avoid repeating the previous structures and try to find inexplicit interactions, we can explore structures that include these variables in a different manner.

One direction could be involving powers of 'du/dx' and 'u'. Due to the dependencies suggested in the example, we also include 't'. As 'du/dx' has not yet been seen in a structure combined with 'u', testing an equation with these terms can be a reasonable choice.

Thus, I propose the following equation structure:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 2 + params[2] * t
    P = 3 # Three parameters are needed for optimizing
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * du/dx ** 2 + c[2] * t"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, P
```

This structure includes the terms 'du/dx * u', 'du/dx ** 2', and t, none of which have been seen in the exp_buffer before. The possible interaction between 'du/dx' and 'u' along with 'du/dx ** 2', which can represent an impact of the gradient on the change of u, could allow for a better description of the system. The 't' term is added for completeness given the repetitive presence in previous attempts.
