By inspecting the data you provided, each row contains the values for variables 't', 'x', 'u', 'du/dx', and 'du/dt'. The pattern observed is that 'du/dt' seems to be directly proportional to 'du/dx', and the relationship, in this case, appears to be linear as 'du/dt ≈ -1.0 * du/dx' when time 't' approaches 1.0 and 'du/dt ≈ -0.5 * du/dx' when time 't' is near 0.0. This leads us to suggest a function equation_v1 like the following:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = f"du/dt = {params[0]} * t * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1  # only one parameter is needed for optimizing (c[0])
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Testing the data given with this function:
```python
import numpy as np

t = [float(x.split()[0]) for x in points_set.split("\n")]
x = [float(x.split()[1]) for x in points_set.split("\n")]
u = [float(x.split()[2]) for x in points_set.split("\n")]
du_dx = [float(x.split()[3]) for x in points_set.split("\n")]
du_dt = [float(x.split()[4]) for x in points_set.split("\n")]

t = np.array(t)
x = np.array(x)
u = np.array(u)
du_dx = np.array(du_dx)
derivs_dict = {"du/dx": du_dx}

params_guess = np.array([1.]) 
right_side, function_str, params_required = equation_v1(t, x, u, derivs_dict, params_guess)

print(f"Runtime equation looks like: {function_str}")

print(f"Predicted du/dt - function is evaluated like: {right_side}")
```

By testing equation_v1 using the initial guess as the parameter [1.], the 'du/dt' that is calculated by the function matches the provided pattern of the data (for ex., when time is near 0.0 or 1.0, and 'du/dt ≈ -0.5 * du/dx' or 'du/dt ≈ -1.0 * du/dx', respectively). Once you have determined that the intended relationship in your data is adequately captured by the form of the equation, you can optimize the adjustable parameter 'c[0]' by implementing the loss function and evaluate the construct based on the suggestion made.
