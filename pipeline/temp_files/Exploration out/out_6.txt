After analyzing the experimental buffer, we notice equations with poorer scores include those with complex expressions like exponentials, powers, and non-linear dependencies. Meanwhile, the equation "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * du/dx ** 2 + c[2] * t" demonstrates a better score.

We should attempt to construct a new equation by expanding on the existing successful candidates, focusing on interactions between the derivatives and the variables. For instance, the equation "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx" might be improved by incorporating the du/dx square term, which seems to contribute positively in the equations with a higher success rate.

Therefore, my suggested equation is:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * u + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    P = 3 # There are three parameters required for optimization
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * u + c[1] * t * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx) ** 2"
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, P

```

This model retains the linear dependency on time and u*du/dx from the candidate equation, while introducing a squared component of du/dx inspired by the equations with a higher success rate, to explore potential nonlinear interactions.
