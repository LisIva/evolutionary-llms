The points set you've provided suggests that there is a linear relationship between the du/dt and du/dx values, with a slight adjustment factoring in the value of 't'. Observing the pattern, it seems that du/dt is closely linked with du/dx, and the value of 't' stems a progressive increase in the relationship between du/dt and du/dx.

The simplest function that complies with this pattern could be:

    'du/dt = a * du/dx + b * t'

where a and b are parameters to be determined.

Implementing this into Python function (equation_v1) based on the request would look something like this:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict['du/dx'] + params[1] * t
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

Given this proposed equation, params[0] and params[1] would be coefficients corresponding to 'a' and 'b' in the mentioned analytical form. 

Please be informed that in order to solve for 'a' and 'b', the loss_function and evaluate() will need to be called with input data and subsequently optimized using scipy.optimize.minimize.
