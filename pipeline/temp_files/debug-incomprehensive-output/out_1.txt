To generate an equation in the structure `du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx)`, we need first to consider the data points and how `du/dt` changes with respect to `du/dx`. Considering that the problem requires that the equation be dependent on at least one derivative, and the information from the `exp_buffer` suggesting that `0.0 * du/dx` does not correlate well, let's form an equation hypothesis.

Observations:

- By checking the pattern of the data points, particularly focusing on the relationship between `du/dx` and `du/dt`, it can be seen that there is a direct linear relationship.
- The data also suggests that for a similar `du/dx`, the `du/dt` values decrease with an increase in `t`, implying the effect of `t` being a multiplier.

Hypotheses:

Let's think of the possible contributions of `t`, `x`, `u`, and `du/dx` to the equation and suggest something like `du/dt = F(t) * du/dx` or `du/dt = F(x) * du/dx`. Considering the observations, an equation like `du/dt = c * t * du/dx` might be a good guess to start as it captures the relationship between `s` (which is denoted as `t` here), `du/dx`, and `du/dt`.

Given the presence of a constant in the equation, we have to include it in the parameters to fit. This leads us to the following equation structure:

```
du/dt = c * t * du/dx
```

The code to generate this function would be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

The reason for choosing this equation is that it introduces a direct multiplication of `t` and `du/dx`, while maintaining the dependency on the derivative `du/dx` and allows for optimization of the constant 'c' to fit the given data points. The score of this guess could be determined by evaluating the function `evaluate()` on the `equation_v1()`. However, let's write a complete function based on the above discussion. This time, let's make `du/dx` as a sum of other parameters, introducing two free parameters.

The updated function, considering the mentioned requirements and observations, can be coded as:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    right_side += params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```
```{note} The exact form of the equation proposed here is a hypothesis based on the given data and requirements. The successful fit or the goodness of this hypothesis could be determined through running the function within the provided framework and evaluating its score.
