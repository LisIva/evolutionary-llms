Given the input data and the information in `exp_buffer`, we need to create a new equation that isn't already in the `exp_buffer` and tries to fit the data as accurately as possible. One promising approach is to try to incorporate both `t` and `du/dx` in the equation structure, given the provided points and the structure of `exp_buffer`.

Since we need to ensure the new equation is different and attempts to improve the accuracy based on the existing equation attempts, we can modify the structure to include an exponential term that combines both `t` and `du/dx`.

### Equation Structure
A good approach might be:
\[ \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \exp(c[1] \cdot t) \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \]

Here, `c[0]` and `c[1]` are parameters to be optimized, and the exponential term adds a non-linear dependence on `t` to adjust the influence of `du/dx`.

Let's implement this equation structure.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Extract parameters
    c0 = params[0]
    c1 = params[1]

    # Construct the right-hand side of the equation
    right_side = c0 * np.exp(c1 * t) * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * exp(c[1] * t) * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2

    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Equation Form**: The equation takes the form \( \frac{du}{dt} = c[0] \cdot \exp(c[1] \cdot t) \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \).
2. **Parameters**: `params` contains two parameters `[c0, c1]` which will be optimized.
3. **Dependence on Derivatives**: The right side of the equation involves the derivative `du/dx`, ensuring that it fits the requirement of having a derivative in the equation.

This equation is likely to capture the time dependence seen in the data more effectively than a linear one. The exponential term should provide a more flexible model, potentially leading to better fits.
