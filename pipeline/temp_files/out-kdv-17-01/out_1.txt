To tackle this problem, we need to understand the equation's format and constraints as well as the provided data. Firstly, the equation should follow the general form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3) while strictly depending on at least the 'du/dx' derivative. We must also aim for an equation whose string representation does not appear in the exp_buffer dictionary. Considering the exp_buffer, we can understand that an equation of the form 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1]' is not optimal since the score is significantly high (1.0). 

Looking at the data, we see that derivative terms change as 't' and 'x' vary, implying that 'du/dt' could potentially be a function of 't', 'x', 'u', 'du/dx', 'd^2u/dx^2', or 'd^3u/dx^3'. 

Given the complexity of the input data and the numerous variables available, coming up with a straightforward function that predicts 'du/dt' might be challenging. To account for this complexity, one possible equation could include 'du/dx', 't', 'x', and 't * du/dx'. This selection is aimed at making use of multiple dimensions of the data while adhering to the stipulated requirements. 

Therefore, the suggested equation_v1 might be 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x'. Here, 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are coefficients that need to be optimized, whereas 't * du/dx' and 'x' are the features that must be included in the equation's right side. Here, 't*du/dx' dealign with the temporal changes and 'x' accounting for the spatial changes, which are fundamental to the problem's context. 

However, we keep the equation relatively simple to ensure it can be handled by the optimization algorithm and make it easy to interpret, allowing for clear understanding of the equation's structure and implications.

Let's construct the equation_v1 function with these considerations:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x
    string_form_of_the_equation = 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x'
    len_of_params = 2

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The above function suggests an equation that represents a combination of the time-varying derivative (t * du/dx) and the spatial variable 'x'. It's clear, maintainable, and fundamentally grounded in understanding the data's nature and previous attempts (as captured in the exp_buffer). Such a method requires minimizing the loss between the predicted values and actual 'du/dt' values to find the optimal coefficients for 't * du/dx' and 'x'. It's worth noting that this proposed equation has not appeared in the exp_buffer, therefore fulfilling the requirement as well.
