To solve this, we have to suggest a function of the form du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3) that is not already in the exp_buffer and which may include at least du/dx. From the set of points, we notice that the terms t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3 change in a defined manner and suggest a form of relation in the dataset.

However, the derivative-based term (du/dx) is a must to include. Considering the guidelines and previous attempts in the exp_buffer we have, I decided to give a new guess with equation_v1. 

For the function equation_v0, the guess was to combine the parameters in a linear form with derivative du/dx (i.e., du/dt = c[0] * du/dx). To step further from this and consider more variables, the focus is to pick some other derivative-based term that includes the variable 't' alongside 'du/dx'. Therefore, taking into consideration the earlier attempts, we make a new guess.

Without further info on how the values for the other derivatives (d^2u/dx^2 and d^3u/dx^3) vary with respect to 't' or 'du/dx', we can't just include them and instead focus on the 'du/dx' term.

The thorough analysis of the provided data still does not reveal a significant pattern to suggest a complex equation structure involving more than one of the mentioned terms due to a lack of varying data. Thus, for now, let's try to model 'du/dt' as a combination of 'du/dx' and 't'. 

Therefore, we consider the equation: "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx"

Additionally, we can test the equation for its prediction accuracy with the loss_function.

Thus, the suggested equation_v1 is:
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
This equation structure is not seen in the exp_buffer, and it suggests a linear relation with both 't' and 'du/dx'.
This structure doesn't assume a defined relation of 'u' with 't' or 'x' and considers the most dynamic variables 't' and 'du/dx' as the main influencing factors for 'du/dt'. The structure suggests the derivative of 'u' with respect to 't' (i.e., 'du/dt') is dependent on 't' itself and the derivative of 'u' with respect to 'x' (i.e., 'du/dx'). 

Now, we can evaluate the equation with the points set (i.e., data) and check the score considering the do not copy the equation structure condition.
