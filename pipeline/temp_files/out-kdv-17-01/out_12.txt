Based on the provided data set and previous attempts stored in exp_buffer, a plausible structure for the function equation_v1 can be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * x
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx + c[2] * x"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
The structure of equation_v1 proposed here is similar to previously tried structures, but introduces the variable 'x' which was not present in the previous best attempt. This new equation so constructed should possess a negative score when evaluated, but testing it would be the proper way to validate this deduction.  

This equation depends on 'du/dx', as required, and includes 't', 'x' and 'du/dx', while not heavily resembling previous structure in exp_buffer. The proposed equation combines time, space and the derivative of u with respect to x, assigning them shareable weights (c[0], c[1] and c[2]) for optimization.
