```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In the proposed solution, I haven't copied the equations from the exp_buffer dictionary and have suggested an equation that is not already present in the form 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2'. The simplified form of the equation is already presented in the string_form_of_the_equation variable, with no further simplifications needed. The right_side of the equation is dependent on the derivative du/dx, as required, and also considers the t and (du/dx)**2 terms.
