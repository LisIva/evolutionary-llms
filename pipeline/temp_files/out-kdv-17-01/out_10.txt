After analyzing the provided data and exp_buffer, it is observed that the dynamics of \(du/dt\) is closely tied to \(du/dx\) and \(t\). Given that the simplest form of the equation is \(du/dt = c[0] * du/dx\) with a score of 1.0, we can consider adding more complexity by incorporating terms involving the variable 't' with the derivative \(du/dx\). A suggestion could be to add a term that is proportional to \(t * (du/dx)^2\) to the equation, since 't' and 'du/dx' both play significant roles in the dynamics based on our previous experiences (exp_buffer). This structure was not unsuccessful in the past (exp_buffer does not contain this particular combination) and it includes the derivative 'du/dx' as required.

Here is how it can be coded:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
In the proposed equation, 'c[0]' is the coefficient of 'du/dx', while 'c[1]' is the coefficient of the term 't*(du/dx)^2'. This function calculates the 'right_side' which should be equal to 'du/dt' and defines the 'string_form_of_the_equation' to show the exact structure of the function. The 'len_of_params' gives the number of parameters {c[0], c[1]} to be adjusted.
