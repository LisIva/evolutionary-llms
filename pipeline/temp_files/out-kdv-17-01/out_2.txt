The function `equation_v1` should offer a proposition for du/dt that is not yet in exp_buffer and takes into account the advice from equation_v0. If we look at the data and the previous attempts in the exp_buffer, we can guess that du/dt is a function of t, du/dx, and possibly other values in the input set. Let's construct a new equation that takes all these into account, but emphasizes the role of du/dx as required.

Looking at previous results, we might suggest:

du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2]

However, this equation form is already in the exp_buffer. To skip over it, and ensure uniqueness, we can add variable x as a parameter to the equation. Our new suggestion for du/dt will be:

du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] + c[3] * x

To construct the function into the same format as `equation_v0`, the code would be:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):

    # Construct the du/dt equation
    du_dt = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u + params[2] + params[3] * x
    # Construct the string representation of the equation
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u + c[2] + c[3] * x"
    len_of_params = 4

    return du_dt, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This new function `equation_v1` will now be fed into the loss function and evaluated based on the provided data `points_set`. The resulting optimized parameters and the form of the suggested du/dt equation will be used in further computations. Ensure there is no duplication with equations in the `exp_buffer` and any variable included in the equation is uniquely identified in the string form of the equation, as noted in the requirements of the question.
