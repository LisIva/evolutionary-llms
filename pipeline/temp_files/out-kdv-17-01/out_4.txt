Looking at the data and the information given, one possible version of the equation_v1 function could be formulated as follows:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] * x + params[1] * t + params[2] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx * x + c[1] * t + c[2] * u"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation is different from the equations in the exp_buffer. It takes into account the spatial variable (x), time (t) and the original value (u), not just the derivatives. The equation incorporates the dataset's properties that indicate that the derivative du/dt is not solely determined by du/dx (as potentially suggested by the simplest form 'du/dt = F(t, du/dx)') but is influenced by the position x, time t, and the value of u as well.

The multiplication of du/dx with x is supported by the increasing du/dt for larger x values when other variables stay constant. The t term accounts for the behavior over time, and introducing the u into the equation to consider its impact on the derivative can potentially refine model accuracy because there's a dependency on u as observed in the data.

Please note that you would have to run the minimize function again with this updated equation to get the optimal parameters, and this equation does not assert an absolute understanding of system behavior - it is, instead, a guess proposed based on the given limitations and data distribution. The true model complexity and behavior are not necessarily disclosed within the task requirements, hence the equation might need adjustments and iterations for better approximation. Make sure to check the scoring system with this structure to validate its efficiency.
