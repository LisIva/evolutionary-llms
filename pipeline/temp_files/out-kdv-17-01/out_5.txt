To generate the code, I will create an equation form that has not been seen in the exp_buffer and still depends on at least one derivative. Since most of the equations in exp_buffer involve combinations of t, du/dx, and u, I will propose an equation form that also involves 'd^2u/dx^2' (the second derivative of u with respect to x). Here is the function corresponding to the equation du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * u.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = derivs_dict["du/dx"]*params[0] + derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]*params[1] + u*params[2]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0]*du/dx + c[1]*d^2u/dx^2 + c[2]*u"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This function takes arrays t, x, u, and a dictionary derivs_dict. derivs_dict should contain keys for the derivatives we are interested in. The function also takes a params array which will be the coefficients for our suggested equation form. The function returns the right side of the equation, the equation's string form, and the number of parameters.

Please note that the derivatives, du/dx and d^2u/dx^2, should be pre-computed and available in derivs_dict. The function assumes that the derivatives were already obtained and saved in derivs_dict. If they haven't been calculated before, you will need to add code to compute them before you can call this function. 

To ensure the function is not repeating a previously attempted equation form, compare the `string_form_of_the_equation` to the keys of the `exp_buffer` dictionary. If the equation form hasn't been seen before, determine its evaluation score using the `evaluate` function provided in the input. This will determine if the new form is an improvement over past attempts.
