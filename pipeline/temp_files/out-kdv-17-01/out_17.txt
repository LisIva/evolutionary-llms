Based on the data and the existing equations in the `exp_buffer`, I'll suggest a new equation that incorporates the dependencies on `t`, `x`, and `du/dx` while ensuring that the equation is not a direct copy of any existing equations. The new equation will be simpler than some of the more complex ones but still dependent on `du/dx`.

Here's the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * x
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * x"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation combines terms involving `t`, `x`, and `du/dx` in a way that is different from the existing equations in the `exp_buffer`. It includes both a linear and a product term with `t` and `du/dx`, and also includes a term with `x`.
