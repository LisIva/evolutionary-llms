Based on the data and the guidelines set forth, let's make use of the information we have in `exp_buffer` to suggest a new equation for `du/dt`. The best score previously obtained is `1.0` for the equation `du/dt = c[0] * du/dx`, which means we need to modify this equation to carve out a new solution space. Careful examination of scores hints that the complexity involving `u`, `t`, `x`, and `du/dx` derivatives might be not directly necessary here. One possible modification might contain considering a cubic term for `du/dx` as none of the `exp_buffer` equations does, being careful to keep the purpose of the equation while adhering to the instructions.

Therefore, the code implementing this guess is given here:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = derivs_dict["du/dx"] ** 3 * t * params[0] + derivs_dict["du/dx"] * params[1]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * (du/dx)**3 + c[1] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Here, we changed the structure of the equation by adding a cubic term for `du/dx` to the equation to suggest a new form. This new equation is significantly distinct from the existing ones in the `exp_buffer`.

Ensure that no outright copying from the existing equations takes place and we did our due diligence to heed to the instruction to look at the `exp_buffer` before making the suggestion.

The independent variable `t` is again incorporated into the equation, as it was beneficial in the previously described `exp_buffer` equations. We have to create a new equation string utilizing the proposed structure, and then return it together with the corresponding computed right side of the equation and the length of `params`.

In this structure, our goal is to expand the search space with an equation not previously investigated, while maintaining the purpose of the problem. This example sets a new precedent of complexity in formulating `du/dt` while still being connected with the `exp_buffer` examination.
