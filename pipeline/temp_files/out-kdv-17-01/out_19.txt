To suggest a new equation based on the input data and the existing `exp_buffer`, we need to explore different forms of the equation that have not been tried before and ensure it is dependent on at least one derivative, specifically `du/dx`.

Based on the input data and the `exp_buffer`, we can propose a new equation that incorporates both `t` and `du/dx`, and includes a quadratic term for `du/dx`. Here is the suggested equation:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

This equation introduces a new structure that includes both linear and quadratic terms of `du/dx`, as well as a term that couples `t` and `du/dx`. This structure has not been explored in the previous attempts and ensures the equation is dependent on the derivative `du/dx`.
