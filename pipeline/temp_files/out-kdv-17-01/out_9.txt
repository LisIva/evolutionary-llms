After analyzing the previous equations in the exp_buffer and the trends in the derivative data, let's suggest the following form for equation_v1.

We are searching for an equation structure that is not yet in exp_buffer and that has been already evaluated with the score function. We note that "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx" has been evaluated and has a relatively low score. However, none of the previous equations specifically model the 'du/dx' term as a function of 't'. Thus, we can modify this equation, by including an additional 't' dependency in the 'du/dx' term, increasing the complexity of the equation a bit: "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * t * du/dx".

Given the scale and signs of 't', 'du/dx', and 'du/dt', we can suppose 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' could be positive.

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * t * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

This proposed equation treats 'du/dx' on the right side of the equation as an explicit function of 't', the idea being that the rate of change of 'u' with respect to 'x' changes over time. The constant 'c[1]' therefore adjusts the effect of 't' on this derivative.

Let's also remember not to simply copy existing equations in the exp_buffer, the string form of the new equation is not yet in the exp_buffer set.
