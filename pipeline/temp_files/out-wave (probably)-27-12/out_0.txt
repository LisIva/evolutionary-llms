Based on the data given in points_set and following the instructions from equation_v0, we will construct a simplified function, equation_v1, with the form d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx, where c[0] is the parameter we aim to optimize.

To incorporate this in the equation_v1 function:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

But before this function, note that we need to process the points_set data and construct the necessary 'inputs' and 'derivs_dict' for our evaluation. We can create these structures by:

1. Separating the data into corresponding arrays for each data column.
2. Constructing the 'inputs' as (t, x, u) and 'derivs_dict' containing the rest of the derivatives data.

Let's complete the parsing and evaluation as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

points_set = points_set.split('\n')[:-1]
data = {}
data['inputs'] = [np.array([float(line.split()[0]) for line in points_set]),\
                  np.array([float(line.split()[1]) for line in points_set]),\
                  np.array([float(line.split()[2]) for line in points_set])]

data["derivs_dict"] = {"du/dt": np.array([float(line.split()[3]) for line in points_set]),\
                   "du/dx": np.array([float(line.split()[4]) for line in points_set]),\
                   "d^2u/dt^2": np.array([float(line.split()[5]) for line in points_set]),\
                   "d^2u/dx^2": np.array([float(line.split()[6]) for line in points_set])}

def evaluate(data: dict):
    inputs, derivs_dict = data['inputs'], data["derivs_dict"]

    # Optimize 'du/dx' coefficient
    loss_partial = lambda params: loss_function(params, *inputs, derivs_dict)
    params_initial_guess = np.array([1.0])
    result = minimize(loss_partial, params_initial_guess, method='BFGS')
    optimized_params = result.x

    # Return evaluation score
    score = loss_function(optimized_params, *inputs, derivs_dict)
    return score if not np.isnan(score) and not np.isinf(score) else None

print(evaluate(data))
```

This completes parsing the data, constructing 'inputs', 'derivs_dict', and evaluating the constructed function equation_v1 with the specified data. The particular `evaluate` function instantiates all the machinery for unique cost function construction, parameter optimization, and application of the data in a customizable framework. This provides the structure for evaluating the constructed equation based on the provided data.

Keep in mind that the `equation_v1` function assumes a structure "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx" in this specific case. Depending on the incoming data and intended use cases, more complex functions may need to be implemented, following a similar construction method.
