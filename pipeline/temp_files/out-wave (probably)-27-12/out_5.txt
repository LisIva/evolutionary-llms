Based on the given points set and considering the previous attempts stored in the exp_buffer, I will propose a new equation that is not yet explored and simplified in its form. The equation will be dependent on at least one derivative as required.

Let's try exploring equations of the form d^2u/dt^2 = F(t, du/dx) since in the 'exp_buffer' the equation "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx" has the lowest score of 6.79 but exploring equations that depend on du/dx**2 or d^2u/dx^2 have not yet provided lower scores, suggesting that these might be significant in the model.

So, let's build an equation like the one mentioned in the 'exp_buffer' but add an additional term considering the time, since the motion described as the function progresses in time and exploring equations that depend on time and derivatives have not yet been tried in this way. This way, I will also meet the criteria of not copying the previous equations but leveraging the scores shown in the exp_buffer to guide this iteration.

Here is the proposed function:

**Function equation_v1:**
```
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

In this code, I've introduced an additional term considering the time, `t`, multiplied by the square of the derivative `du/dx`. This introduces the exploration of how time affects the rate of change squared. This equation has not previously been evaluated, and as the function progresses in time, exploring equations that depend on time and derivatives have not yet been tried in this way. This structure also meets the criteria of not copying the previous equations but leveraging the scores shown in the exp_buffer to guide this iteration.

**Note:** The simplified equation in string_form_of_the_equation is already in the required form as per the guidelines.

The score of this new equation `equation_v1` can then be evaluated using the function `evaluate(...)`, and as the function progresses in time, exploring equations that depend on time and derivatives have not yet been tried in this way, which will provide an updated score based on the goodness of fit of the proposed equation with the given data points.
