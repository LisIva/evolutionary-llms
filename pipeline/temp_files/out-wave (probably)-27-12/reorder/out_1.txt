Based on the provided points and the conditions specified in the problem, let's consider that the resulting equation can depend on the second derivative of u with respect to x (d^2u/dx^2) and the first derivative of u with respect to x (du/dx). Given that the equation should include at least one derivative, I propose to explore a relation involving the second derivative, since this is required by the conditions posed.

Looking at the data presented, we see patterns consistent with a simplified relationship involving second order derivatives, which should be the center of our attention given the posed problem. Based on this, and assuming the structure posed by the equation could be simplified to incorporate terms derived from the second and first derivative with respect to x, I propose the following form:

\[d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * (du/dx)^2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2\]

Given the presence and patterns of values for the second derivative, I also harmonically divide the second derivative, revealing that the system may contain physics with a phenomenon occurring along the x-dimension. Hence, a polynomial of the form \((du/dx)^2\) could adhere to this observation and provide a viable candidate.

Let's then suggest this form as equation_v1 while respecting the guidelines provided:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
  right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2 + params[1] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
  string_form_of_the_equation = "d^2u/dt^2 = c[0] * (du/dx)**2 + c[1] * d^2u/dx^2"
  len_of_params = 2
  return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```

As this form has not been previously considered and it includes at least one derivative (du/dx), it could supply a path to find the equation according to the constraints and variable options herein. Remember, for the sake of this solution, du/dx will represent the derivative on \(x\) and will not be computed relative to any derivative on \(t\) since the goal is to meet the minimum of having at least one derivative, matching the set of derivatives made available.
