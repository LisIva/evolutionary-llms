This function looks into the experiments buffer for a structure involving 'du/dx' and uses it to generate the form of equation_v1. If no structure is found, it defaults to "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx". The form of the right side, the string representation of the equation (str_eq), and the number of parameters (len_of_params) are determined based on the chosen structure from the experiments buffer.
