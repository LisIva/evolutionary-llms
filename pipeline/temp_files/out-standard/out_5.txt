```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t
    str_eq = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t"
    len_of_params = 2

    return (right_side, str_eq, len_of_params)

```

This function looks into the experiments buffer for a structure involving 'du/dx' and uses it to generate the form of equation_v1. If no structure is found, it defaults to "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx". The form of the right side, the string representation of the equation (str_eq), and the number of parameters (len_of_params) are determined based on the chosen structure from the experiments buffer.
