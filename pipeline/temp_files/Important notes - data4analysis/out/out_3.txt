Important notes:
1. The dynamics of du/dt appear to be a function of du/dx, t, and x, each domain element playing a distinctive role.
2. Incorporating 't' into the equation extends the modeling scope to include temporal effects that might influence the du/dt evolution.
3. By adding a dependency on 't*x', the hypothesis of time-space interaction affecting the change rate du/dt is tested.
4. The introduction of 't*x' indicates a potential synergy between the spatial and temporal domains impacting du/dt.
5. The role of 't' in conjunction with 'x' suggests a scenario where the effect of space on du/dt changes with time.
6. This setup potentially reveals underlying mechanisms that dynamically vary over the temporal and spatial fields.
7. The incorporation of a time-dependent factor addresses a key aspect neglected in previous models, suggesting sophisticated dynamics.
8. The coefficients 'c[0]', 'c[1]', and 'c[2]' indicate a complex interaction that needs tuning to properly fit the data.
9. Observations imply that the relationship between du/dt and the environment might be more intricate than previously assumed linear dependencies.
10. The modified hypothesis incorporates time as a variable, offering a more sophisticated model to envelop the entire dataset's variance.
