```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t + params[2] * x * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t + c[2] * x * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
The constructed equation is:
du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t + c[2] * x * du/dx
In this equation, 'du/dx' is kept as a part of the right-hand side since it has showed to be an important factor in the past attempts. Meanwhile, 't' has been included without multiplying it with 'du/dx', providing a direct dependency that has not been tested in the previous equations. Also 'x' is included to provide spatial variability to the function dependence. This structure follows from the earlier observations that both time and distance (in relation to 'du/dx') are significant factors in understanding the evolution of 'u'. 
This updated structure aims to enhance the equation's flexibility to capture more complex behaviors while keeping its interpretation straightforward.

Important notes:
Previous attempts have shown that 'u' does not directly contribute to the equation structure, indicating the primary dependence on 'du/dx'. The inclusion of both 't' and 'x' alongside 'du/dx' has proved beneficial for fitting the equation to the dataset. The updated structure includes 't' and 'x' explicitly, aiming to understand their independent and combined effects on 'du/dx'. This equation form preserves the observed dependencies while introducing new structural elements that might reveal additional insights into the data's underlying dynamics. By keeping 'du/dx' as a part of the equation, the focus remains on understanding the rate of change in 'u' with respect to 'x'. The direct inclusion of 't' and its interaction with 'x' via 'du/dx' aims to better capture the temporal and spatial influences on this rate of change. This structure could potentially reflect more complex interactions at play in the data. Note that the updated equation still anchors on 'du/dx', maintaining consistency with previous scores, which highlighted its significance. The linear combination in the right-hand side with 'c[1] * t' introduces a novel aspect compared to the previous boosting patterns, focusing on the time's role independently before considering its potential interaction with space ('x') through 'du/dx'. Remembering that the best score so far focused on a tripartite relationship between 'du/dx', 't', and 'x', this expanded approach might open new avenues for data fitting while staying consistent with the preceding observations. It's also noteworthy that 'x' manifests both in a direct pairing with 't' and via 'du/dx', aiming to separate spatial impacts from those based on instantaneous change in 'u' with respect to 'x'. This design hypothesis explicitly tests how time ('t') and space ('x') in concert with 'du/dx' might govern the evolution of 'u', building on insights from earlier successful equation forms. All these elements combine to propose an equation that is not only in conversation with prior attempts but iterates forward, aiming for a deeper understanding of the dataset's underlying principles.
