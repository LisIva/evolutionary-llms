Important notes (updated):
1. du/dt seems to have a direct relationship with du/dx, suggesting a significant interaction between slope and time derivative.
2. The inclusion of 'x * du/dx' highlights the spatial influence on the change rate, indicating a possible spread effect.
3. The dependency on 't' emphasizes the temporal dimension, possibly accounting for decay or accumulation effects as time progresses.
4. Combining 't' and 'x * du/dx' reveals a more nuanced model, which might capture the interaction between spatial slope slopes and temporal dynamics.
5. The 't' term is expected to capture temporal trends, providing insights into how du/dt behaves over time without needing space interaction.
6. This formulation considers distinct temporal and spatial effects separately and introduces an interaction component for deeper understanding.
7. The relationship between du/dt and its predictors appears complex, suggesting non-linear interactions and possibly external factors not included in this model.
8. The coefficients 'c[0]', 'c[1]', and 'c[2]' allow for nuanced tuning, offering a flexible framework that may adapt to different types of data distributions.
9. The equation now adjusts previous assumptions by acknowledging the multifaceted nature of du/dt dynamics within the analyzed data points.
10. The latest form tackles issues raised by discrepancies in model predictability by expanding the space-time interaction hypothesis, contributing to clearer interpretations.
11. The introduction of x * du/dx might help in explaining the spatial dynamics of the field beyond the restriction isolated to the temporal factor, potentially recognizing multi-directional influences.
