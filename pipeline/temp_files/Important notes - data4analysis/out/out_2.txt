Important notes:
1. Preliminary analysis showed that the change rate du/dt is closely linked with the derivative du/dx.
2. The introduced equation explores the hypothesis that du/dt might depend on both du/dx and x, indicating a spatially variant rate of change.
3. By including an x-factor multiplying du/dx, the proposed model explores how the relationship between du/dt and du/dx changes spatially.
4. This modification offers a structured way to account for any potential spatial effects on the relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
5. The role of 'x' in the equation emphasizes the possible impact of spatial dimensions on the evolutionary behavior of du/dt.
6. Such consideration could reflect underlying physical or system properties that vary with x.
7. The coefficients 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are to be tuned to accurately capture these physical properties.
8. The initial feedback indicates that a linear dependence on du/dx does not fully capture the dataset's nuances, suggesting sophistication.
9. Empirical observations indicate that there might be an underlying functional relationship involving both du/dx and x.
10. The relation with 'x' is introduced to better align with observations by considering the spatial dimension's potential influence on du/dt.
11. This alteration casts light on how spatial variables influence du/dt and opens up new avenues for granular analysis of system dynamics.
