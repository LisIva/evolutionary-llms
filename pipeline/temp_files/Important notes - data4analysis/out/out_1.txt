Important notes:
1. Prior exploration suggested a linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx with a constant multiplicative factor. 
2. The proposed equation includes a modified component accounting for potential t-dependence of the relationship between du/dt and du/dx.
3. A notable trend indicating that the relationship might not be purely constant across t suggests the need for an additive term that scales with t and du/dx.
4. Initial exploration in the buffer indicates a strong correlation between du/dt and du/dx, but does not fully account for the role of t.
5. This adjusted representation aims to accommodate how du/dt changes with du/dx and by what factor this relationship is influenced by t.
6. The coefficients 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are required to quantify the core relationship and the t-dependent variation respectively.
7. The adjustment explicitly acknowledges t's influence without overcomplicating the model, focusing on the detected variations.
8. The intent is to provide a more accurate description of how du/dt evolves with du/dx and how the variable t could influence this evolution.
9. The general form ensures it can encompass a wider range of the dynamic behavior depicted in the dataset.
10. The linear terms included here both address the primary influence of du/dx on du/dt and the potential modulation of this relationship by t.
11. Further refinement could include more complex t-dependencies but is initially left simple following Occam's Razor.
