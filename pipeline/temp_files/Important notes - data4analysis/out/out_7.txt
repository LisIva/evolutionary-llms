Important notes:
1. The best approach so far averages a score of 96.0, closer to 0 is better.
2. Trial fits that incorporated factors like 't' and both 't' and 'du/dx' have shown to yield the best results.
3. Introducing a product of time and position 't*x' in conjunction with the derivative 'du/dx' doesn't seem to perform as well as including 't' alone.
4. Derivatives 'du/dx' have been consistently included in the equations, implying it holds substantial information about the system's dynamics.
5. Higher scoring configurations have typically involved both 'du/dx' and 't', indicating the importance of time-varying effects.
6. The initial set involving 'du/dx' and 't' was very competitive.
7. There's suggestion of an interaction between 't' and 'du/dx', but 't*x' was not as successful.
8. Scores obtained from combinations involving multiple derivatives, 't', and 'x' showed a variety in performance, with 't' and 'du/dx' combinations leading to the best models.
9. An interesting finding was that 'du/dt' did not need to be directly included in the equations to achieve a competitive score.
10. This pursuit is about finding the most relevant aspects of 't', 'x', and derivatives without simplifying to a form that makes the equation overly straightforward. 
11. Introducing a product of time and derivative 't*du/dx' was a fruitful direction.
12. Simplifying equations to linear forms with derivative 'du/dx' while including 't' has proven to be beneficial.
13. Attempts to include 'x' directly in the equations with time 't' have not matched the performance of 't' alone.
14. The relationship between 't' and 'du/dx' is significant, suggesting there is underlying dynamics that these variables capture effectively.
15. The score evaluation method prefers equations that balance the relevance of 't', 'x', and derivatives, rather than weighing one factor heavily over others.
