Important notes:
1. The relationship appears to be generally linear between du/dt and du/dx with a slight deviation that could suggest a multiplicative factor depending on the value of "t".

2. Given the consistency of the ratio between du/dt and du/dx across different data points,
with a near-constant relationship yet slight variance with "t", it's practical to propose a relationship such as du/dt = -c * du/dx.

3. The coefficient 'c' can be estimated to be close to 1, reflecting the general trend from the data
without considering the variance with "t", assuming simplicity and generalization, leading to an initial estimate of 'c' at 0.995.

4. This approximate relationship, despite ignoring the multiplicative effect of "t",
effectively captures the core dynamic of the data, given that the rate of change in 'u' relative to 'x' (du/dx)
is predominantly what influences du/dt, aside from slight variations attributable to "t".

5. The equation thus described is a straightforward linear relationship using 'du/dx' to predict 'du/dt',
with a negative coefficient implying that 'du/dt' decreases as 'du/dx' increases, considering the negative trend observed in the data.
