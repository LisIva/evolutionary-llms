Based on the information provided, the differential equation does not seem to be highly complex and the penalties given for past attempts are quite severe, indicating that the equation should be simple. Taking into account the previous attempts with 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx' and 'du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * x + c[2] * u + c[3] * du/dx + c[4] * d^2u/dx^2', we can propose a new equation which includes 'du/dx' and other terms, but not those evaluated in the past.

We could propose something like 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2', which doesn't reuse the equations that have been previously evaluated and takes into account the condition of dependence on at least one derivative. 

Here is the Python code corresponding to that formula:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
Please note that the values of 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' would need to be determined using the optimization or fitting routine of your choice. 
The form of the equation proposed is educated guess but it may not necessarily provide the best fit. This step is one part of the iterative process of model fitting and parameter estimation. Further evaluation and adjustments of the model may be necessary. 
Without a knowledge of the underlying system or process that produced the data, it's also challenging to propose meaningful physical or mathematical motivations for specific terms in the equation. The equation proposed here is based purely on statistical and machine learning principles. Higher order terms and interaction terms have been introduced to allow for a more complex relationship between the variables.
