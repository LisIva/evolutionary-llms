To create a new guess for the structure of the equation, we need to observe the patterns in the points_set data and the equations present in the `exp_buffer`. We can see that most equations involve `du/dx` and some combination of `t`, `u`, `d^2u/dx^2`, and their multiplications.

As a new guess, we might consider an equation that is not in `exp_buffer` yet, and incorporates higher-order derivative `d^3u/dx^3` as one of its terms. After looking at `exp_buffer`, none of the so far guessed equations include `d^3u/dx^3`.

A possible function can take the form of:
`du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * d^3u/dx^3`

However, let's simplify it to make sure we don't copy existing formulas from the `exp_buffer`:
`du/dt = c[0] * t + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * d^3u/dx^3`

To make sure that our guess is correct and satisfies the requirements, we should also check that the suggested equation is dependent on at least one derivative, and `du/dx` is included as seen above.
