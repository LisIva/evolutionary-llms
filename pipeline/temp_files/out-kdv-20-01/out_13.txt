Based on the provided data and the constraints given, it seems no current entry in the exp_buffer fits well or is simple enough. Also, it's critical to use at least the first derivative 'du/dx' as per the mandate. We can attempt to construct an equation that is not yet present in the exp_buffer and that incorporates 'du/dx' which is a requirement.

After analyzing the given data points and exp_buffer, it is clear that the equations in the exp_buffer don't offer a score close to 0 that we are looking for in an ideal scenario. There is a distinct absence of du/dt dependency on higher order derivatives such as 'd^2u/dx^2' or 'd^3u/dx^3' in the existing attempts. This suggests the complexity of equations hasn't been productive, and a simpler approach might be helpful.

Based on the nature of the data and previous attempts, a new guess could be based on the assumption that 'du/dt' is proportionally influenced by 'du/dx' and 'u'. This idea can be driven from the whisperings that many of the outputs ('du/dt') are directly proportional to the inputs ('du/dx' and 'u').

So, let's create the proposed equation_v1 based on a simplified version of this projection, with trying to keep dependencies on 'du/dx' and 'u':

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * u"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

The function equation_v1 provides a linear relation between 'du/dt', 'du/dx', and 'u' that haven't been represented in the current experiment buffer (exp_buffer). This structure makes sure that the highest score of 0 (an ideal score here) from exp_buffer doesn't replicate.

Consequently, appreciate that this form does not have the direct dependencies on 't' and 'x', but it completes the mandate to suggest a new equation with 'du/dx' dependency and not mirror anything in the exp_buffer. Invoking a new equation here doesn't entirely exclude needs of 't' and 'x' or higher order derivatives, just not deemed necessary based on the current results housed in exp_buffer.

In summary, an equation_v1 is presented keeping requirements in mind, which is both novel and simple while making sure there's a dependency on 'du/dx'. 

But it's also commendable to note, each scenario or problem space can potentially require a tailored approach for structuring the right equation. The provided equation_v1 is better suited from baselines provided, may not be the absolute best, but a good starting point to improve upon.
