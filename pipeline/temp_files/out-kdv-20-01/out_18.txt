To propose a new equation while taking into account the experimental buffer provided (exp_buffer), we look for a structure not yet seen while ensuring the final string representation does not resemble any in the buffer. Given that equations with the du/dx derivative were common in exp_buffer, we generate a new equation considering:
1. Proportional relationships between du/dt and x or t (since these do not appear as often in the buffer).
2. Nonlinear interaction between two derivatives (i.e., du/dx and a second or higher derivative), which have not been included in any extant equations.

Therefore, a tentative new equation could be: du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * (du/dx)^2

Let's implement this new equation_v1.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict=dict(), params=np.array([1.0]*3)):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * x * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"])**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * x * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * (du/dx)**2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
