Based on the provided data, a possible function that fits the description and is not in the exp_buffer could be:

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * u * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]**2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

The equation form suggested takes a look at the best equations in the exp_buffer variable and uses the aspects that tend to correlate well with the data:
- The `c[0] * t * du/dx` term is from the equation with the best score in the exp_buffer.
- The `c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2` term comes from the second best calculation in the exp_buffer.
- I have introduced a new element `c[2] * (du/dx)^2` to the form, adding a square of the first derivative which is not present in the results of previous attempts made as stored in the exp_buffer.

So, instead of converting any things from the exp_buffer, the function generates a model that's not in the exp_buffer based on the formula for a new equation as follows:
> du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1] * u * d^2u/dx^2 + c[2] * (du/dx)^2

Such a form of the equation is due to the intent to make a hypothesis that could provide a better fit to the experimental data, being motivated by scores from exp_buffer.

With such a prepared function, one could obtain the right-hand side of the differential equation in a format that can be further used for numerical solution and also in the form of a string as a mathematical model.

This version of the equation includes only variables from input data and intermediate calculations in expressions du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3).

In the current equation, the derivatives "du/dx," "d^2u/dx^2," and "(du/dx)^2" are included, so it meets the given requirements interconnected with the function signature.

The variable t is included, which is also a requirement.

In the equation "du/dt = F(t, x, u, du/dx, d^2u/dx^2, d^3u/dx^3)", derivatives of higher than 2nd order (e.g., "d^3u/dx^3") are not involved, but this is not against the requirements of the task.

Additionally, it is worth emphasizing that the form of the equation has been simplified - all the brackets have been eliminated, as the function parameters specify the coefficients added to the variables without parentheses, for instance, "c[0] * t * du/dx". This meets the simplification condition where all formulas have been opened, and parentheses are not present in the output.
