After analyzing the points_set and the scores in the exp_buffer, we are looking for a possible function that is not yet explored and has a good potential to describe the data by considering the derivatives as well. The simplest form 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx' had a score of 843, so let's construct a new equation that includes 'du/dx' and also checks if the multiplication of 'c[0]' with 'du/dx' and 't' improves the fit; if not, we will use the simplest form as the equation has to be dependent on at least one derivative, which is 'du/dx'.

Let's try 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1]', where 'du/dt' is the derivative we are trying to represent, 't' is time, 'du/dx' is the spatial gradient of the function, and 'c[0]' and 'c[1]' are constants. The constant 'c[1]' serves an offset. This structure is deliberately simple and untested in the exp_buffer yet, and it incorporates all the conditions specified above.

Let's implement this in equations_v1:

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1]"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

We suggest `equation_v1` to be 'du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1]', which includes elements not previously attempted. The 't' introduces time dependence, 'du/dx' satisfies the dependence on a derivative condition, and 'c[1]' ensures that our equation includes an offset, offering more flexibility to adapt to the points_set's pattern.
```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx + c[1]"
    len_of_params = 2
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```
