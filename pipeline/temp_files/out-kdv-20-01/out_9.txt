To create a new guess for the equation that is not in the exp_buffer, and adheres to the constraints set in the question, **we can start by looking at cross interactions** of the variables as suggested by the patterns in the data. Specifically, we can explore an equation which involves `du/dx`, `u`, `t`, `x`, `d^2u/dx^2`, and possibly `d^3u/dx^3`. Since it's important to avoid copying the structures that have been attempted in the past, we adopt a new form that isn't completely similar to the ones that have been evaluated, with an intentional effort to involve `t` and `x` in a different way.

Given that most of the previous equations have a linear relationship with variables, we can introduce a quadratic or cubic relationship involving `t` and `x`. Also, with an intent to avoid replicating former attempts, let's adopt an equation form that exploits second and third derivatives, as these relationships have not extensively been the centre of experimentation in the existing buffer.

A potential guess could be including not just linear relationships but also quadratic and cubic relationships to see if there's a spot for another pattern type in the equation. Due to this understanding, we will now generate a model with the following structure:

- `du/dt = c[0]* (du/dx + u) + c[1] * u * (t + x) + c[2] * (d^2u/dx^2) * (t^2 + x^2) + c[3] * t^3 + c[4] * x^3`


However, we need to ensure this is not a copy of the existing equations in the exp_buffer but a novel form. The verification would be done by comparing it against the existing equations and observing if there's a structural match is attempted too often in the past.

Let's implement `equation_v1` function with the given guidelines:

```python

def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):

    # c0 * (du/dx + u)
    # c1 * u * (t + x)
    # c2 * (d^2u/dx^2) * (t^2 + x^2)
    # c3 * t^3
    # c4 * x^3
    right_side = (params[0] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"] + u)) + (params[1] * u * (t + x)) + (params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"] * (t**2 + x**2)) + (params[3] * t**3) + (params[4] * x**3)
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * ( du/dx + u ) + c[1] * u * ( t + x ) + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2 * (t^2 + x^2) + c[3] * t^3 + c[4] * x^3"
    len_of_params = 5

    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params

```

This approach ensures that we are testing a new form, expanding the exploration while avoiding repetitious experimentation. As mentioned in the question, while constructing the equation, we ensure that it's unique and not merely replicated from the exp_buffer. It is an inclusive approach towards the general structure while evaluating new patterns.
