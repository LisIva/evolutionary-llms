Based on the provided dataset and considering the previous attempts in the `exp_buffer`, we can analyze that the loss value is significantly reduced as we include more variables and derivative terms in the equation. Observing the progression from simpler to more complex models, the best performing equation involves `t`, `du/dx`, `x`, and `u`. However, the requirement is to generate a new guess for the equation that is not present in the `exp_buffer` with an evaluation score of 0 (indicating the best performance). 

Given the context, although the exact pattern to achieve a 0 loss score is not clear, it is evident that the inclusion of multiple variables and their interactions has led to improved performance over single-variable models. Here, an assumption is made that the complete interaction of `t`, `du/dx`, `x`, and `u` with possible additions might lead to better performance.

For the next equation, we could consider an equation structure dependent on `t`, `du/dx` with an additional involvement of `t * du/dx` (given that `t * du/dx` term has been successful previously) and also introduce a non-linear term to capture additional complexities or nonlinear effects in the data. Given that `u` and `x` have not been explicitly successful in previous attempts, though they've been included before, we might still incorporate them, but in a non-linear fashion or in interaction terms. Moreover, including higher-order derivatives (e.g., `du/dx` squared) could potentially capture more complex dynamics.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * t * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"]+ params[3] * (derivs_dict["du/dx"]) ** 2
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx + c[1] * t * du/dx + c[2] * u * du/dx + c[3] * (du/dx)^2"
    len_of_params = 4
    return (right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params)
```
This answer includes all terms which have been seen in the exp_buffer, but has not been previously searched. The inclusion of both the non-linear term `(du/dx)^2` and the `u * du/dx` interaction term serve as an attempt to model possibly uncovered dynamics.

> Note: the 'evaluate' function is using this function to evaluate potential equation skeletons. The loss function is used to find the parameters that minimize the loss for a given equation skeleton. The result is that the equation skeleton (and the string that describes it) with the lowest final loss is selected. The code above generates a new equation skeleton based on the losses associated with previous skeletons. This new equation skeleton is then used to find the parameters that minimize the loss, and the resulting loss, which will be the evaluation score of this skeleton, is returned. If the evaluation score is lower than the ones associated with previous skeletons, then this new skeleton will be selected over the old ones.
