Important notes:

The latest modeling attempt introduces an equation that draws on the combined influence of spatial gradient (du/dx) and the interplay between the temporal derivative itself (du/dt) and the second spatial derivative (d^2u/dx^2). This illustrates a dynamic system where the rate of change over time not only reacts to its spatial gradient but also to how the strain rate (d^2u/dx^2) modulates the temporal shift.

The parameters "c[0]" and "c[1]" delineate the quantitative and directional aspects of these impacts. Specifically, "c[0]" reflects the fundamental impact of the spatial gradient on the rate of change over time, while "c[1]" encapsulates the adjustment of this spatial influence by the strain rate considering the function's temporal evolution.
