Based on the provided data and the exploration buffer, let's start exploring the function space with a hypothesis. Given that `du/dx` is known to play a role, and that `u` and `t` most likely interact in a non-trivial way (as suggested by the nature of PDEs and ODEs), we will explore a quadratic interaction with `du/dx`, a linear relation with `u`, and potentially involve `t` in a non-trivial way interacted through `u`. We could also introduce an interaction with `d^2u/dx^2` to explore second derivative involvement, but I will postpone introducing higher-order interactions to understand simpler structures first and reserve them for possible expansions later if necessary.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    right_side = params[0] * u * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[1] * derivs_dict["du/dx"] + params[2] * derivs_dict["d^2u/dx^2"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * u * du/dx + c[1] * du/dx + c[2] * d^2u/dx^2"
    len_of_params = 3
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Explanation:
- `c[0] * u * du/dx`: This term introduces a quadratic interaction between `u` and the first derivative `du/dx`. This can capture the dependence of derivative changes on the function value, potentially modeling an acceleration-like effect.
- `c[1] * du/dx`: This term provides a linear relation with the first derivative `du/dx`, similar to the base exploration in the buffer.
- `c[2] * d^2u/dx^2`: To expand exploration into higher-order relationships, which could help identify any specific dynamics related to curvature aspects of the function.

This function can be tested to assess its fitness using the `evaluate` function and the provided data points. Depending on the score, further iterations might introduce additional terms or modify the existing ones based on the observed interactions. If the score is not satisfactory, or if the score is quite good yet exploration suggests potential for a better fit in the function space, we could expand upon this by incorporating more interactions (such as `t`, `x`, higher powers of `u`, interactions with `d^2u/dt^2` if that derivative was found to contribute well to other successful terms), or by refining the coefficients and their relationship with `u`, `du/dx`, and possibly `d^2u/dx^2`.
