Based on the given points_set, one simple structure seen is that the du/dt values have a significant relationship with du/dx. Considering only a single parameter, we aim to construct a relation where du/dt is roughly equal to a constant * du/dx.

Here is a function that reflects this relationship proposed as equation_v1, alongside the string form of the equation for clarity and the number of parameters used.

```python
def equation_v1(t: np.ndarray, x: np.ndarray, u: np.ndarray, derivs_dict: dict(), params: np.ndarray):
    # Construct equation: du/dt = c[0] * du/dx
    right_side = params[0] * derivs_dict["du/dx"]
    string_form_of_the_equation = "du/dt = c[0] * du/dx"
    len_of_params = 1
    return right_side, string_form_of_the_equation, len_of_params
```

Note: As per the provided data, we can identify patterns/relationship among available derivatives considering a simple linear relationship as the initial guess for equation_v1 function estimation, which can be further improved by incorporating more complex functions as parameters in case of more complex dynamics in the data. The choice of function form 'du/dt = c[0] * du/dx' can be considered as initial guess; the actual complexity can be adapted using more sophisticated methods like gradient boosting, optimizing parameters with stochastic gradient descent or any machine learning-based methodology depending upon the dynamics observed in data. This basic function can serve as a skeleton for such complex methodologies.
