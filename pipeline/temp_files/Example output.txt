Important notes:
Previously observed trends in the data showed a nearly linear relationship between du/dt and du/dx. 
This time we observed that the rate at which du/dt changes with respect to du/dx appears to be more pronounced 
for higher values of "t", pointing to a potential multiplicative or exponential trend.
The relationship du/dt = -c * du/dx, while capturing the overall trend, 
did not account for the influence of "t", hence the adjustment.
The new equation du/dt = c[0] * t * du/dx captures a decaying rate of change dependent not only on du/dx 
but also on the length of time (t).
This captures a more refined perspective on the data's evolving dynamics.
